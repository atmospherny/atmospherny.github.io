current sheets can develop in the solar corona, and give valuable information
about the connectivity in complicated magnetic field configurations. However,
calculating QSL maps even for 2-dimensional slices through 3-dimensional models
of coronal magnetic fields is a non-trivial task as it usually involves tracing
out millions of magnetic field lines with immense precision. Thus, extending
QSL calculations to three dimensions has rarely been done until now. In order
to address this challenge, we present QSL Squasher -- a public, open-source
code, which is optimized for calculating QSL maps in both two and three
dimensions on GPUs. The code achieves large processing speeds for three
reasons, each of which results in an order-of-magnitude speed-up. 1) The code
is parallelized using OpenCL. 2) The precision requirements for the QSL
calculation are drastically reduced by using perturbation theory. 3) A new
boundary detection criterion between quasi-connectivity domains is used, which
quickly identifies possible QSL locations which need to be finely sampled by
the code. That boundary detection criterion relies on finding the locations of
abrupt field-line length changes, which we do by introducing a new Field-line
Length Edge (FLEDGE) map. We find FLEDGE maps useful on their own as a
quick-and-dirty substitute for QSL maps. QSL Squasher allows constructing
high-resolution 3D FLEDGE maps in a matter of minutes, which is two orders of
magnitude faster than calculating the corresponding 3D QSL maps. We include a
sample of calculations done using QSL Squasher to demonstrate its capabilities
as a QSL calculator, as well as to compare QSL and FLEDGE maps.

one-arm spiral instability in long-lived hypermassive neutron stars (HMNSs)
formed in dynamical capture binary neutron star mergers. Employing hydrodynamic
simulations in full general relativity, we find that the one-arm instability is
generic in that it can develop in HMNSs within a few tens of milliseconds after
merger for all equations of state in our survey. We find that mergers with
stiffer equations of state tend to produce HMNSs with stronger $m=2$ azimuthal
mode density deformations, and weaker $m=1$ components, relative to softer
equations of state. We also find that for equations of state that can give rise
to double-core HMNSs, large $m=1$ density modes can already be present due to
asymmetries in the two cores. This results in the generation of $l=2$, $m=1$
gravitational wave modes even before the dominance of a one-arm mode that
ultimately arises following merger of the two cores. Our results further
suggest that stiffer equations of state give rise to HMNSs generating lower
$m=1$ gravitational wave frequencies. Thus, if gravitational waves from the
one-arm instability are detected, they could in principle constrain the neutron
star equation of state. We estimate that, depending on the equation of state,
the one-arm mode could potentially be detectable by second generation
gravitational wave detectors at $\sim 10$ Mpc and by third generation ones at
$\sim 100$ Mpc. Finally, we provide estimates of the properties of dynamical
ejecta, as well as the accompanying kilonovae signatures.

for planets and to test theories of planet formation, migration, and evolution.
We present our search for, and characterization of, transiting planets in the
$\simeq$800 Myr old Praesepe (Beehive, M44) Cluster from K2 light curves. We
identify seven planet candidates, six of which we statistically validate to be
real planets. For each host star we obtain high-resolution NIR spectra to
measure its projected rotational broadening and radial velocity, the latter of
which we use to confirm cluster membership. We obtain low-resolution optical
and NIR spectroscopy for each system, which we use in conjunction with the
cluster distance and metallicity to provide precise temperatures, masses,
radii, and luminosities for the host stars. Combining our measurements of
rotational broadening, rotation periods from the K2 light curves, and our
derived stellar radii, we show that all planetary orbits are, within errors,
aligned with their host star's rotation. To constrain the planets' parameters
we fit the K2 light curves including a prior on stellar density to put
constraints on the planetary eccentricities, all of which are consistent with
zero. The difference between the number of planets found in Praesepe and Hyades
($\simeq800$ Myr) and a similar dataset for Pleiades ($\simeq125$ Myr) hints of
a trend with age, but may be due to incompleteness of current search pipelines
for younger, faster-rotating stars. We see increasing evidence that some
planets continue to lose atmosphere past 800 Myr, as now two planets at this
age have radii significantly larger than their older counterparts from Kepler.

Population III-like stellar population, or alternatively, be a candidate Direct
Collapse Black Hole (DCBH). In this paper we investigate the evidence for these
exotic scenarios using recently available, deeper, optical, near-infrared and
mid-infrared imaging. We find strong Spitzer/IRAC detections for the main
component of CR7 at 3.6 and 4.5 microns, and show that it has a blue colour
([3.6] - [4.5] $= -1.2\pm 0.3$). This colour cannot be reproduced by current
Pop. III or pristine DCBH models. Instead, the results suggest that the [3.6]
band is contaminated by the [OIII]4959,5007 emission line with an implied
rest-frame equivalent width of EW_0 (H$\beta$ + [OIII]) $\gtrsim 2000$\AA.
Furthermore, we find that new near-infrared data from the UltraVISTA survey
supports a weaker He II 1640 emission line than previously measured, with EW_0
$= 40 \pm 30$\AA. For the fainter components of CR7 visible in Hubble Space
Telescope imaging, we find no evidence that they are particularly red as
previously claimed, and show that the derived masses and ages are considerably
uncertain. In light of the likely detection of strong [OIII] emission in CR7 we
discuss other more standard interpretations of the system that are consistent
with the data. We find that a low-mass, narrow-line AGN can reproduce the
observed features of CR7, including the lack of radio and X-ray detections.
Alternatively, a young, low-metallicity (~1/2000 solar) starburst, modelled
including binary stellar pathways, can reproduce the inferred strength of the
He II and [OIII] emission, and simultaneously satisfy the observational upper
limits on metal lines.

any astrophysical reference system. And indeed, Gaia's internal zero-point
error for parallaxes is likely to be smaller than any individual parallax
error. Nevertheless, due in part to mechanical issues of unknown origin, there
are many astrophysical questions for which the parallax zero-point error
$\sigma(\pi_0)$ will be the fundamentally limiting constraint. These include
the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Galactic Center. We show
that by using the photometric parallax estimates for RR Lyrae stars (RRL)
within 8kpc, via the ultra-precise infrared period-luminosity relation, one can
independently determine a hyper-precise value for $\pi_{0}$. Despite their
paucity relative to bright quasars, we show that RRL are competitive due to
their order-of-magnitude improved parallax precision for each individual object
relative to bright quasars. We show that this method is mathematically robust
and well-approximated by analytic formulae over a wide range of relevant
distances.

design special initial conditions for numerical simulations. We review this
approach and its application to density peaks providing several worked-out
examples. We then critically discuss the recent proposal to use constrained
realisations to modify the linear density field within and around the
Lagrangian patches that form dark-matter haloes. The ambitious concept is to
forge `genetically modified' haloes with some desired properties after the
non-linear evolution. We demonstrate that the original implementation of this
method is not exact but approximate because it tacitly assumes that protohaloes
sample a set of random points with a fixed mean overdensity. We show that
carrying out a full genetic modification is a formidable and daunting task
requiring a mathematical understanding of what determines the biased locations
of protohaloes in the linear density field. We discuss approximate solutions
based on educated guesses regarding the nature of protohaloes. We illustrate
how the excursion-set method can be adapted to predict the non-linear evolution
of the modified patches and thus fine tune the constraints that are necessary
to obtain preselected halo properties. This technique allows us to explore the
freedom around the original algorithm for genetic modification. We find that
the quantity which is most sensitive to changes is the halo mass-accretion rate
at the mass scale on which the constraints are set. Finally we discuss
constraints based on the protohalo angular momenta.

optical transient PSN J09093496+3307204 (SN 2015bh) in the galaxy NGC 2770,
which has transferred into the supernova phase. The observations were carried
out between February 2015 to May 2016. Both at the phase of the SN impostor
(2015a) and at the supernova phase (2015b), besides Balmer emissions, the
strong Fe II emissions are seen in the spectrum; so, these spectra resemble
those of Williams Fe II type classical novae. The star is located near the edge
of a dark nebula and notably absorbed (Av = 1.14 +/-0.15 mag). Taking into
account this absorption, we determined maximum absolute magnitudes of Mv =
-15.0 +/-0.3 mag at the 2015a phase and of Mv = -18.14 +/-0.30 mag at the 2015b
phase. The light curve at the 2015b phase is similar to those of SN IIL. The
supernova progenitor is a luminous blue variable (LBV) star with the powerful
H{\alpha} emission. We considered several hypotheses of supernovae explosions
following optical transients related with LBV. The hypothesis of core collapse
of an evolved massive star interrupting the process of its merging with massive
companion in a binary system (a failed luminous red nova) was chosen as the
preferable one for this event.

global-scale economic and environmental problems of Earth while becoming more
effective at science through the use of space resources. Space programs will be
more cost-effective when they work to establish a supply chain in space, mining
and manufacturing then replicating the assets of the supply chain itself so it
grows to larger capacity. This has become achievable because of advances in
robotics and artificial intelligence. It is roughly estimated that developing a
lunar outpost that relies upon and also develops the supply chain will cost
about 1/3 or less of the existing annual budgets of the national space
programs. It will require a sustained commitment of several decades to
complete, during which time science and exploration become increasingly
effective. At the end, this space industry will capable of addressing
global-scale challenges including limited resources, clean energy, economic
development, and preservation of the environment. Other potential solutions,
including nuclear fusion and terrestrial renewable energy sources, do not
address the root problem of our limited globe and there are real questions that
they may be inadequate or too late. While industry in space likewise cannot
provide perfect assurance, it is uniquely able to solve the root problem, and
it gives us an important chance that we should grasp. What makes this such an
historic opportunity is that the space-based solution is obtainable for free,
because it comes as a side-benefit of doing space science and exploration
within their existing budgets. Thinking pragmatically, it may take some time
for policymakers to agree that setting up a complete supply chain is an
achievable goal, so this paper describes a strategy of incremental progress.

the constraints that one obtains from high-z gamma-ray burst (GRB) rates on
them. We show that at the present time, the GRB rates per unit star-formation
at z&gt;3 are higher than at lower redshift. We also compare metallicity
predictions made using a hierarchical model of cosmic chemical evolution based
on two recently proposed SFRs, one based on the observed galaxy luminosity
function at high redshift and one based on the GRB rate and find that within
the considerable scatter in metal abundance measures, they both are consistent
with the data. Analyzing the ensemble of different measurements together, we
conclude that despite metallicity biases, GRBs may be a less biased probe of
star-formation at z&gt;3 than at z&lt;2. There is likely to be a common origin to the
high GRB rate per unit star-formation and the high observed Lyman-continuum
production rate in high redshift galaxies and that this may be due to a
relative overabundance of stars with mass $&gt;$25Msun which are likely GRB
progenitors. We also find that to reconcile these measurements with the Thomson
scattering cross section of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons measured
by Planck, the escape fraction of Lyman-continuum photons from galaxies must be
low, about 15 percent or less and that the clumping factor of the IGM is likely
to be small, about 3. Finally, we demonstrate that GRBs are unique probes of
metallicity evolution in low-mass galaxy samples and that GRB hosts likely lost
a significant fraction of metals to the intergalactic medium (IGM) due to
feedback processes such as stellar winds and supernovae.

hyper-luminous X-ray source, ESO 243-49 HLX-1. We found a strong observational
evidence that ESO 243-49 HLX-1 underwent spectral transitions from the low/hard
state to the high/soft state during these observations. The spectra of ESO
243-49 HLX-1 are well fitted by the so-{called} bulk motion Comptonization
model for all spectral states. We have established the photon index Gamma
saturation level, Gamma_{sat}$=3.0+/-0.1, in the correlation of Gamma versus
mass accretion rate dot M. This Gamma-dot M correlation allows us to estimate
the black hole (BH) mass in ESO 243-49 HLX-1 to be M_{BH}~ 7x 10^4 solar
masses, assuming the distance to ESO 243-49 of 95 Mpc. For the BH mass estimate
we used the scaling method, taking Galactic BHs XTE~J1550-564, H~1743-322 and
4U~1630-472, and an extragalactic BH source, M101 ULX-1 as reference sources.
The Gamma-dot M correlation revealed in ESO 243-49 HLX-1 is similar to those in
a number of Galactic and extragalactic BHs and it clearly shows the correlation
along with the strong Gamma saturation at ~ 3. This is a reliable observational
evidence of a BH in ESO 243-49 HLX-1. We also found that the seed (disk) photon

high BH mass in ESO 243-49 HLX-1.

particles composed of silicates and organics. We found that 10^8-10^9 kg of
dust particles (assumed to be 0.3 micron - 1 mm) were ejected through each

that of the 17P/Holmes event observed in 2007, the kinetic energy per unit mass

(PPDs). Freeze-out and sublimation processes determine their division between
gas and solid phases, which affects both which disk regions can be traced by
which volatiles, and the formation and composition of planets. Recently,
multiple lines of evidence suggest that CO is substantially depleted from the
gas in the outer regions of PPDs. In this letter, we show that the gas dynamics
in the outer PPDs facilitates volatile depletion through a mechanism which we
term "runaway freeze-out". Using a simple 1D model that incorporates dust
settling, turbulent diffusion of dust and volatiles, as well as volatile
freeze-out/sublimation processes, we show that as long as turbulence in the
cold midplane is sufficiently weak to allow majority of the small grains to
settle, CO in the warm surface layer can be turbulently mixed into the midplane
region and depleted by freeze-out. The level of depletion sensitively depends
on the level of disk turbulence. Based on recent disk simulations that suggest
a layered turbulence profile with very weak midplane turbulence and strong
turbulence at disk surface, CO and other volatiles can be efficiently depleted
by a factor of a few over Myr timescales.

clusters. They have simultaneously generated a number of controversies,
particularly as to whether young star clusters may have the same origin as old
globular clusters. In addition, extensive studies have revealed that the SSP

neglect the effect of external influences, such as the gravitational
interaction with neighbouring stars. Most stars, however, form in clustered
environments that either quickly disperse, or evolve into open clusters. Under
these conditions, young planetary systems experience frequent close encounters
with other stars, at least during the first 1-10 Myr, which affects planets
orbiting at any period range, as well as their debris structures.

049 (2016)] in which we studied the iron K$\alpha$ line expected in the
reflection spectrum of Kerr black holes with scalar hair. These metrics are
solutions of Einstein's gravity minimally coupled to a massive, complex scalar
field. They form a continuous bridge between a subset of Kerr black holes and a
family of rotating boson stars depending on one extra parameter, the
dimensionless scalar hair parameter $q$, ranging from 0 (Kerr black holes) to 1
(boson stars). Here we study the limiting case $q=1$, corresponding to rotating
boson stars. For comparison, spherical boson stars are also considered. We
simulate observations with XIS/Suzaku. Using the fact that current observations
are well fit by the Kerr solution and thus requiring that acceptable
alternative compact objects must be compatible with a Kerr fit, we find that
some boson star solutions are relatively easy to rule out as potential
candidates to explain astrophysical black holes, while other solutions, which
are neither too dilute nor too compact are more elusive and we argue that they
cannot be distinguished from Kerr black holes by the analysis of the iron line
with current X-ray facilities.

regimes in a fully convective star of mass 0.3$M_{\odot}$ rotating with period
of 10 days. The differential rotation law was estimated using the mean-field
hydrodynamic and heat transport equations. For the intermediate parameter of
the turbulent magnetic Reynolds number, $Pm_{T}=3$ we found the oscillating
dynamo regimes with period about 40Yr. The higher $Pm_{T}$ results to longer
dynamo periods. The meridional circulation has one cell per hemisphere. It is
counter-clockwise in the Northen hemisphere. The amplitude of the flow at the
surface around 1 m/s. Tne models with regards for meridional circulation show
the anti-symmetric relative to equator magnetic field. If the large-scale flows
is fixed we find that the dynamo transits from axisymmetric to non-axisymmetric
regimes for the overcritical parameter of the $\alpha$effect. The change of
dynamo regime occurs because of the non-axisymmetric non-linear
$\alpha$-effect. The situation persists in the fully non-linear dynamo models
with regards of the magnetic feedback on the angular momentum balance and the
heat transport in the star. It is found that the large-scale magnetic field
quenches the latitudinal shear in the bulk of the star. However, the strong
radial shear operates in the subsurface layer of the star. In the nonlinear
case the profile of the angular velocity inside the star become close to the
spherical surfaces. This supports the equator-ward migration of the
axisymmetric magnetic field dynamo waves. Results of the nonlinear model
suggest that, the magnetic configuration of the star dominates by the regular
non-axisymmetric mode m=1, forming Yin Yang magnetic polarity pattern (at the
plan perpendicular to the rotation axis) with the strong (&gt;500 G) poloidal

free-free absorption and multi-path scattering in our analysis via a number of
different assumptions about the intervening medium. We consider previous low
frequency surveys alongwith an ongoing survey with the University of Technology
digital backend for the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (UTMOST) as
well as future observations with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping

more FRBs per day, even in the most extreme scenarios where free-free
absorption and scattering can significantly impact the fluxes below 1~GHz. We
also show that UTMOST will detect 1--2 FRBs per month of observations. For
CHIME and HIRAX, the detection rates also depend greatly on the assumed FRB
distance scale. Some of the models we investigated predict an increase in the
FRB flux as a function of redshift at low frequencies. If FRBs are truly

a disc and a gravitationally-powered ILOT. Unlike the case of the more
energetic ILOT V838~Mon, the mass of the destroyed planet is too low to inflate
a giant envelope, and hence the merger remnant stays hot. If our suggested

It is generally accepted that, in Classical T Tauri Stars, the
plasma from the circumstellar disc accretes onto the stellar surface with free
fall velocity, and the impact generates a shock. The impact region is expected
to contribute to emission in different spectral bands; many studies have
confirmed that the X-rays arise from the post-shock plasma but, otherwise,
there are no studies in the literature investigating the origin of the observed
UV emission which is apparently correlated to accretion. Aims. We investigated
the effect of radiative heating of the infalling material by the post-shock
plasma at the base of the accretion stream with the aim to identify in which
region a significant part of the UV emission originates. Methods. We developed
a 1D hydrodynamic model describing the impact of an accretion stream onto the
stellar surface; the model takes into account the gravity, the radiative
cooling of an optically thin plasma, the thermal conduction, and the heating
due to absorption of X-ray radiation. The latter term represents the heating of
the infalling plasma due to the absorption of X-rays emitted from the
post-shock region. Results. We found that the radiative heating of the
pre-shock plasma plays a non-negligible role in the accretion phenomenon. In
particular, the dense and cold plasma of the pre-shock accretion column is
gradually heated up to few $10^5$\;K due to irradiation of X-rays arising from
the shocked plasma at the impact region. This heating mechanism does not affect
significantly the dynamics of the post-shock plasma. On the other hand, a
region of radiatively heated gas (that we consider a precursor) forms in the
unshocked accretion column and contributes significantly to UV emission. Our
model naturally reproduces the luminosity of UV emission lines correlated to
accretion and shows that most of the UV emission originates from the precursor.

self-consistently by run-away protons from a single, yet fading accelerator. In
this model, gamma rays from the CMZ region are produced by protons injected in
the past, while gamma rays from the inner region are produced by protons
injected more recently. We suggest that the blast wave formed in a tidal

flare events from AT Mic. Whereas the distant component AU Mic has evolved
rotationally as a single star, the A and B components of AT Mic, separated by
about 27 AU, exhibit a rotation rate a factor 5 larger than AU Mic. Moreover,
the A and B components, despite have about equal mass, show a significant
difference (about 40%) between their rotation periods. A possible explanation
is that the gravitational forces between the A and B components of AT Mic (that

lifetime and the disc-locking phase duration, making the component A and B of
AT Mic to rotate faster than the more distant AU Mic. We suspect that a
different level of magnetic activity between the A and B components of AT Mic

were detected in HI 21cm line using the Giant Meter-wave Radio Telescope
(GMRT). The median blue band magnitude of our sample is ~ -11.6, which is more
than one magnitude fainter than earlier FIGGS survey. From our GMRT
observations we find that, for many of our sample galaxies, the HI disks are
offset from their optical disks. The HI diameters of the FIGGS2 galaxies show a
tight correlation with their HI mass. The slope of the correlation is 2.08 +/-
0.20 similar to what is found for FIGGS galaxies. We also find that for almost
all galaxies, the HI disks are larger than the optical disks which is a common
trend for dwarf or spiral galaxies. The mean value of the ratio of HI to
optical diameter is ~ 1.54.

light, ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma ray band, and enters into the era of full

different observation time, requires the data fusion technology. In this paper
we introduce the cross-match tool that is developed by the Python language and
based on the PostgreSQL database and uses Q3C as the core index, facilitating
the cross-match work of massive astronomical data. It provides four different
cross-match functions, namely: I) cross-match of custom error range; II)
cross-match of catalog error; III) cross-match based on the elliptic error
range; IV) cross-match of the nearest algorithm. The cross-match result set
provides good foundation for subsequent data mining and statistics based on
multiwavelength data. The most advantage of this tool is a user-oriented tool
applied locally by users. By means of this tool, users may easily create their
own databases, manage their own data and cross-match databases according to
their requirements. In addition, this tool is also able to transfer data from
one database into another database. More importantly, the tool is easy to get

structure. Many of which can be associated to interactions with nearby moons
and moonlets. Possibly the most interesting and dynamic place in the rings,
probably in the whole Solar System, is the F ring. A highly disrupted ring with
large asymmetries both radially and azimuthally. Numerically non zero
components to the curl of the velocity vector field (vorticity) in the
perturbed area of the F ring post encounter are witnessed, significantly above
the background vorticity. Within the perturbed area rich distributions of local
rotations is seen located in and around the channel edges. The gravitational
scattering of ring particles during the encounter causes a significant elevated
curl of the vector field above the background F ring vorticity for the first
1-3 orbital periods post encounter. After 3 orbital periods vorticity reverts
quite quickly to near background levels. This new found dynamical vortex life
of the ring will be of great interest to planet and planetesimals in
proto-planetary disks where vortices and turbulence are suspected of having a
significant role in their formation and migrations. Additionally, it is found
that the immediate channel edges created by the close passage of Prometheus
actually show high radial dispersions in the order ~20-50 cm/s, up to a maximum
of 1 m/s. This is much greater than the value required by Toomre for a disk to
be unstable to the growth of axisymmetric oscillations. However, an area a few
hundred km away from the edge shows a more promising location for the growth of
coherent objects.

A notable example
is the HST-1 knot in M87. Such features are commonly interpreted as
re-confinement shocks in hydrodynamic jets or focusing nozzles in Poynting
jets. In this paper we compute the structure and Lorentz factor of a highly
magnetized jet confined by external pressure having a profile that flattens
abruptly at some radius. We find the development of strong oscillations upon
transition from the steeper to the flatter pressure profile medium. Analytic
formula is derived for the location of the nodes of these oscillations. We
apply the model to the M87 jet and show that if the jet remains magnetically
dominated up to sub-kpc scales, then focusing is expected. The location of the
HST-1 knot can be reconciled with recent measurements of the pressure profile
around the Bondi radius if the jet luminosity satisfies $L_j\simeq10^{43}$
erg/s. However, we find that magnetic domination at the collimation break
implies a Lorentz factor in excess of $10^2$, atypical to FRI sources. A much
lower value of the asymptotic Lorentz factor would require substantial loading
close to the black hole. In that case HST-1 may be associated with a
collimation nozzle of a hydrodynamic flow.

QSO B0218+357 is a gravitationally lensed blazar located at a
redshift of 0.944. The gravitational lensing splits the emitted radiation into
two components, spatially indistinguishable by gamma-ray instruments, but
separated by a 10-12 day delay. In July 2014, QSO B0218+357 experienced a
violent flare observed by the Fermi-LAT and followed by the MAGIC telescopes.
Aims. The spectral energy distribution of QSO B0218+357 can give information on
the energetics of z ~ 1 very high energy gamma- ray sources. Moreover the
gamma-ray emission can also be used as a probe of the extragalactic background
light at z ~ 1. Methods. MAGIC performed observations of QSO B0218+357 during
the expected arrival time of the delayed component of the emission. The MAGIC
and Fermi-LAT observations were accompanied by quasi-simultaneous optical data
from the KVA telescope and X-ray observations by Swift-XRT. We construct a
multiwavelength spectral energy distribution of QSO B0218+357 and use it to
model the source. The GeV and sub-TeV data, obtained by Fermi-LAT and MAGIC,
are used to set constraints on the extragalactic background light. Results.
Very high energy gamma-ray emission was detected from the direction of QSO
B0218+357 by the MAGIC telescopes during the expected time of arrival of the
trailing component of the flare, making it the farthest very high energy
gamma-ray sources detected to date. The observed emission spans the energy
range from 65 to 175 GeV. The combined MAGIC and Fermi-LAT spectral energy
distribution of QSO B0218+357 is consistent with current extragalactic
background light models. The broad band emission can be modeled in the
framework of a two zone external Compton scenario, where the GeV emission comes
from an emission region in the jet, located outside the broad line region.

with the CRISP instrument at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. Physical
observables, such as Dopplergrams calculated from line bisectors and Stokes V
zero-crossing wavelengths, and Stokes V maps in the far red wing, are used to
find regions where supersonic Evershed downflows may exist. We retrieve the LOS
velocity and the magnetic field vector in these regions using two-component
inversions of the observed Stokes profiles with the help of the SIR code. We
follow these regions during their lifetime to study their temporal behavior.
Finally, we carry out a statistical analysis of the detected supersonic
downflows to characterize their physical properties. Supersonic downflows are
contained in compact patches moving outward, which are located in the mid and
outer penumbra. They are observed as bright, roundish structures at the outer
end of penumbral filaments that resemble penumbral grains. The patches may
undergo fragmentations and mergings during their lifetime, even some of them
are recurrents. Supersonic downflows are associated with strong and rather
vertical magnetic fields with a reversed polarity compared to that of the
sunspot. Our results suggest that downflows returning back to the solar surface
with supersonic velocities are abruptly stopped in dense deep layers and
produce a shock. Consequently, this shock enhances the temperature and is
detected as a bright grain in the continuum filtergrams, which could explain
the existence of outward moving grains in the mid and outer penumbra.

The photon spectrum of this source is best described by a power-law with an

broadband GeV-TeV emission over four decades of energies can be well fitted by
a single power-law function with an index of 2.0, without obvious indication of

recent years. These numerical models seek an explanation of the thermal and
non-thermal emission of these systems as seen by observations. In the
non-thermal regime, radio and X-ray emission is observed for several of these
colliding-wind binaries, while gamma-ray emission has so far only been found in
$\eta$ Carinae and possibly in WR 11. Energetic electrons are deemed
responsible for a large fraction of the observed high-energy photons in these
systems. Only in the gamma-ray regime there might be, depending on the
properties of the stars, a significant contribution of emission from neutral
pion decay. Thus, studying the emission from colliding-wind binaries requires
detailed models of the acceleration and propagation of energetic electrons.
This in turn requires a detailed understanding of the magnetic field, which
will not only affect the energy losses of the electrons but in case of
synchrotron emission also the directional dependence of the emissivity. In this
study we investigate magnetohydrodynamic simulations of different colliding
wind binary systems with magnetic fields that are strong enough to have a
significant effect on the winds. Such strong fields require a detailed
treatment of the near-star wind acceleration zone. We show the implementation
of such simulations and discuss results that demonstrate the effect of the

Galileo telescope to attempt, for the first time ever, experiments of optical
intensity interferometry (a` la Hanbury Brown and Twiss) on a baseline of a few

the original goals for the development of our instrumentation. To carry out
these measurements, we are experimenting a new way of coupling the instruments
to the telescopes, by means of moderate-aperture, low-optical-attenuation
multi-mode optical fibers with a double-clad design. Fibers are housed in
dedicated optical interfaces attached to the focus of another instrument of the
1.8 m telescope (Aqueye+) or to the Nasmyth focus of the 1.2 m telescope

AzTEC1 and AzTEC3, benefit from previous CO line observations, we studied their
properties in more detail. We found that 63% of our target SMGs lie above the
galaxy main-sequence by more than a factor of 3, and hence are starbursts. The
3 GHz radio sizes we have previously measured for the target SMGs were compared
with the present stellar mass estimates, and we found that the z&gt;3 SMGs are
fairly consistent with the mass-size relationship of z~2 compact, quiescent
galaxies (cQGs). The median IR-radio correlation parameter is found to be
q=2.27, which is lower than measured locally (median q=2.64). AzTEC1 is found
to have a sub-Eddington SFR surface density (by a factor of 2.6), while AzTEC3
appears to be an Eddington-limited starburster. The gas reservoir in these two
high-z SMGs would be exhausted in only ~86 and 19 Myr at the current SFR,
respectively. A comparison of the MAGPHYS-based properties of our SMGs with
those of equally bright ALESS SMGs suggests that the two populations share
fairly similar physical characteristics, including the q parameter. A hint of
negative correlation is found between the 3 GHz size and the level of
starburstiness, and hence cosmic-ray electrons in more compact starbursts might
be more susceptible to free-free absorption. Some of the derived low and high q
values (compared to the local median) could be the result of a specific
merger/post-starburst phase of galaxy evolution. Overall, our results support
the scenario where z&gt;3 SMGs evolve into today's giant ellipticals.

strongly variable, polarized multi-wavelength emission from relativistic jet
sources such as blazars, via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) of relativistic
particles. This paper summarizes recent results on a self-consistent coupling
of diffusive shock acceleration and radiation transfer in blazar jets. We
demonstrate that the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars
strongly constrain the nature of hydromagnetic turbulence responsible for
pitch-angle scattering by requiring a strongly energy-dependent pitch-angle
mean free path. The prominent soft X-ray excess ("Big Blue Bump") in the SED of
the BL Lac object AO 0235+164 can be modelled as the signature of bulk Compton
scattering of external radiation fields by the thermal electron population,
which places additional constraints on the level of hydromagnetic turbulence.
It has further been demonstrated that internal shocks propagating in a jet
pervaded by a helical magnetic field naturally produce polarization-angle
swings by 180$^o$, in tandem with multi-wavelength flaring activity, without
requiring any helical motion paths or other asymmetric jet structures. The
specific application of this model to 3C279 presents the first consistent,
simultaneous modeling of snap-shot SEDs, multi-wavelength light curves and
time-dependent polarization signatures of a blazar during a polarization-angle

model, in which the high-energy emission is dominated by proton synchrotron
radiation. It is shown that in this case, the high-energy (X-ray and
$\gamma$-ray) polarization signatures are expected to be significantly more
stable (not showing PA rotations) than the low-energy (electron-synchrotron)
signatures.

detecting moderate-redshift ($z \sim 1$) sources in very-high-energy (VHE; $E &gt;
100$ GeV) $\gamma$-rays by ground-based Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope
facilities. It has been shown in previous work that this prospect is not
hampered by potential $\gamma-\gamma$ absorption effects by the intervening
(lensing) galaxy, nor by any individual star within the intervening galaxy. In
this paper, we expand this study to simulate the light-bending effect of a
realistic ensemble of stars. We first demonstrate that, for realistic
parameters of the galaxy's star field, it is extremely unlikely (probability
$\lesssim 10^{-6}$) that the direct line of sight between the $\gamma$-ray
source and the observer passes by any star in the field close enough to be
subject to significant $\gamma\gamma$ absorption. Our simulations then focus on
the rare cases where $\gamma\gamma$ absorption by (at least) one individual
star might be non-negligible. We show that gravitational light bending will
have the effect of avoiding the $\gamma-\gamma$ absorption spheres around
massive stars in the intervening galaxy. This confirms previous results by
Barnacka et al. and re-inforces arguments in favour of VHE $\gamma$-ray
observations of lensed moderate-redshift blazars to extend the redshift range
of objects detected in VHE $\gamma$-rays, and to probe the location of the
$\gamma$-ray emission region in those blazars.

explains how a cosmologically relevant light scalar can avoid the constraints
of intra-solar-system searches for fifth-forces. The chameleon is a popular
dark energy candidate and also arises in $f(R)$ theories of gravity. Whilst the
chameleon is designed to avoid historical searches for fifth-forces it is not
unobservable and much effort has gone into identifying the best observables and
experiments to detect it. These results are not always presented for the same
models or in the same language, a particular problem when comparing
astrophysical and laboratory searches making it difficult to understand what
regions of parameter space remain. Here we present combined constraints on the
chameleon model from astrophysical and laboratory searches for the first time
and identify the remaining windows of parameter space. We discuss the
implications for cosmological chameleon searches and future small-scale probes.

affect the surface transport of magnetic flux, as well as their impact on the
generation of the Sun's poloidal field. The inflows constitute a potential
non-linear mechanism for the saturation of the global dynamo and may contribute
to the modulation of the solar cycle in the Babcock-Leighton framework.
</p>
<p>Methods: We build a surface flux transport code incorporating a parametrized
model of the inflows and run simulations spanning several cycles. We carry out
a parameter study to assess how the strength and extension of the inflows
affect the build-up of the global dipole field. We also perform simulations
with different levels of activity to investigate the potential role of the
inflows in the saturation of the global dynamo.
</p>
<p>Results: We find that the interaction of neighbouring active regions can lead
to the occasional formation of single-polarity magnetic flux clumps
inconsistent with observations. We propose the darkening caused by pores in
areas of high magnetic field strength as a plausible mechanism preventing this
flux-clumping. We find that inflows decrease the amplitude of the axial dipole
moment by a $\sim30\,\%$, relative to a no-inflows scenario. Stronger (weaker)
inflows lead to larger (smaller) reductions of the axial dipole moment. The
relative amplitude of the generated axial dipole is about $9\%$ larger after
very weak cycles than after very strong cycles. This supports the inflows as a
non-linear mechanism capable of saturating the global dynamo and contributing
to the modulation of the solar cycle within the Babcock-Leighton framework.

first order Corotation Eccentric Resonance (CER), in the framework of the
Planar, Eccentric and Restricted Three-Body problem near a m+1:m mean motion
commensurability (m integer). While capture into Lindblad Eccentric Resonances
(where the perturber's orbit is circular) has been investigated years ago,
capture into CER (where the perturber's orbit is elliptic) has not yet been
investigated in detail. Here, we derive the generic equations of motion near a
CER in the general case where both the perturber and the test particle migrate.
We derive the probability of capture in that context, and we examine more
closely two particular cases: (i) if only the perturber is migrating, capture
is possible only if the migration is outward from the primary. Notably, the
probability of capture is independent of the way the perturber migrates
outward; (ii) if only the test particle is migrating, then capture is possible
only if the algebraic value of its migration rate is a decreasing function of
orbital radius. In this case, the probability of capture is proportional to the
radial gradient of migration. These results differ from the capture into
Lindblad Eccentric Resonance (LER), where it is necessary that the orbits of
the perturber and the test particle converge for capture to be possible.
Possible applications for planetary satellites are discussed.

accommodate the universal $p^{-5}$ spectra observed under many different
conditions in the inner heliosphere. In this model, in order to avoid an
infinite build up of particle pressure, a relationship between the momentum
diffusion of particles and the adiabatic deceleration in the solar wind must
exist. This constrains both the spatial and momentum diffusion coefficients and
results in the $p^{-5}$ spectrum in the presence of adiabatic losses in the
solar wind. However, this theory cannot explain the presence of such spectra
beyond the termination shock, where adiabatic deceleration is negligible. To
explain this apparent discrepancy, we include the effect of charge exchange
losses, resulting in new forms of both the spatial and momentum diffusion
coefficients that have not previously been considered. Assuming that the

on-chip spectroscopy and multi-pixel imaging with advanced detectors. The drive
for large scale detector microchips is demanding NbTiN films with uniform

experimental comparison between two reactive d.c. sputter systems with
different target sizes: a small target (100 mm diameter) system and a large
target (127 mm x 444.5 mm) one, with the aim of improving the film uniformity
using the large target system. We focus on the Tc of the films and I-V
characteristics of the sputter plasma, and we find that both systems are
capable of depositing films with Tc&gt;15 K. We find that these films are
deposited within the transition from metallic to compound sputtering, at the
point where target nitridation most strongly depends on nitrogen flow. Key in
the deposition optimization is to increase the system's pumping speed and gas
flows to counteract the hysteretic effects induced by the target size. Using

the frame where gravity is de-mixed from the scalar this is due to disformal
couplings of matter species to the gravitational sector, with disformal
coefficients that depend on the gradient of the scalar field. In the frame
where matter is minimally coupled, it originates from the so-called beyond
Horndeski quadratic Lagrangian. We extend the Effective Theory of Interacting
Dark Energy by allowing disformal coupling coefficients to depend on the

the conditions to avoid ghost and gradient instabilities and we define Kinetic
Matter Mixing independently of the frame metric used to described the action.
We study its phenomenological consequences for a $\Lambda$CDM background
evolution, first analytically on small scales. Then, we compute the matter
power spectrum and the angular spectra of the CMB anisotropies and the CMB
lensing potential, on all scales. We employ the public version of COOP, a
numerical Einstein-Boltzmann solver that implements very general scalar-tensor
modifications of gravity. Rather uniquely, Kinetic Matter Mixing weakens
gravity on short scales, predicting a lower $\sigma_8$ with respect to the
$\Lambda$CDM case. We propose this as a possible solution to the tension
between the CMB best-fit model and low-redshift observables.

isolated from the photosphere, and consequently are incapable of utilizing this
energy. This opens up the opportunity for life to evolve alternate mechanisms
for harvesting available energy. Bacterium Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator,
found 2.8 km deep in a South African mine, harvests energy from radiolysis,
induced by particles emitted from radioactive U, Th and K present in
surrounding rock. Another radiation source in the subsurface environments is
secondary particles generated by Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs). Using Monte Carlo
simulations, it is shown that it is a steady source of energy comparable to
that produced by radioactive substances, and the possibility of a slow
metabolizing life flourishing on it cannot be ruled out. Two mechanisms are
proposed through which GCR-induced secondary particles can be utilized for
biological use in subsurface environments: (1) GCRs injecting energy in the
environment through particle-induced radiolysis, and (2) organic synthesis from
GCR secondaries interacting with the medium. Laboratory experiments to test
these hypotheses are also proposed. Implications of these mechanisms on finding

self-interaction of dark matter. Viability of the models of long-range
interacting DM crucially depends on the effectiveness of recombination of the
DM particles, making thereby their interaction short-range. Usually in numeric
calculations, recombination is described by cross section obtained on a
feasible quantum level. However in a wide range of parameter values, a
classical treatment, where the particles are bound due to dipole radiation, is
applicable. The cross sections, obtained in both approaches, are very different
and lead to diverse consequences. Classical cross section has a steeper
dependence on relative velocity, what leads to the fact that, after decoupling
of DM particles from thermal background of "dark photons" (carriers of DM
long-range interaction), recombination process does not "freeze out",
diminishing gradually density of unbound DM particles. Our simplified estimates
show, that at the taken parameter values (the mass of DM particle is $100$ GeV,
interaction constant is $100^{-1}$, and quite natural assumptions on initial
conditions, from which the result is very weakly dependent) the difference in
residual density reaches about $5$ orders of magnitude on pre-galactic stage.
This estimate takes into account thermal effects induced by dipole radiation
and recombination, which resulted in the increase of both temperature and
density of DM particles by a half order of magnitude.

halo formation time is different from the observation time, we have to consider
the evolution of the halo bias parameter. It will be shown that any deviation
from $\Lambda$CDM model will change the evolution of the bias as well.
Therefore, it is deduced that the halo bias depends strongly on the sub-sample
of galaxies which is chosen for cross correlation and that the joint kernel of
ISW effect and the galaxy distribution has a dominant effect on the observed

orbital circularity of the progenitor at infall is only important for low-mass
satellites: dynamical friction efficiently radialises the most massive minor
mergers erasing the imprint of the infall orbit for satellite-to-host virial
mass ratios $\gtrsim1/20$. The kinematics of the stars contributed by each

electromagnetic cascades, contributing to the isotropic gamma-ray background

sources. This posits a stringent upper limit on the IGRB generated via UHECR
propagation, and subsequently constrains their abundance in the distant
Universe. Focusing on the contribution of UHECR at energies below the ankle
within a narrow energy band ($(1-4)\times 10^{18}$eV), we calculate the diffuse
gamma-ray flux generated through UHECR propagation, normalizing the total
cosmic ray energy budget in this band to that measured. We find that in order
to not over-produce the new IGRB limit, a local "fog" of UHECR produced by
nearby sources may exist, with a possible non-negligible contribution from our
Galaxy. Following the assumption that a given fraction of the observed IGRB at

freeze-out mechanism operating within the singlet sector. We investigate this
scenario in detail. In particular, we show that requiring the absence of
inflationary isocurvature fluctuations provides lower bounds on the magnitude
of the dark sector self-interactions and in parts of the parameter space favors
sufficiently large self-couplings, supported also by the features observed in
the small-scale structure formation.

Atmospheric loss led to depressurization and cooling, and is thought to be the
primary driving force responsible for the loss of liquid water from its
surface. Recently, MAVEN observations have provided new insight into the
physics of atmospheric loss induced by ICMEs and solar wind interacting with
the Martian atmosphere. In addition to solar radiation, it is likely that its
atmosphere has been exposed to radiation bursts from high-energy astrophysical
sources which become highly probable on timescales of ~Gy and beyond. These
sources are capable of significantly enhancing the rates of photoionization and
charged particle-induced ionization in the upper atmosphere. We use Monte Carlo
simulations to model the interaction of charged particles and photons from
astrophysical sources in the upper Martian atmosphere and discuss its
implications on atmospheric loss. Our calculations suggest that the passage of
the solar system though dense interstellar clouds is the most significant
contributor to atmospheric loss among the sources considered here.

XLVII. Planck constraints on reionization history.</a></summary><p>We investigate constraints on cosmic reionization extracted from the Planck
cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. We combine the Planck CMB anisotropy
data in temperature with the low-multipole polarization data to fit LCDM models
with various parameterizations of the reionization history. We obtain a Thomson
optical depth tau=0.058 +/- 0.012 for the commonly adopted instantaneous
reionization model. This confirms, with only data from CMB anisotropies, the
low value suggested by combining Planck 2015 results with other data sets and
also reduces the uncertainties. We reconstruct the history of the ionization
fraction using either a symmetric or an asymmetric model for the transition
between the neutral and ionized phases. To determine better constraints on the
duration of the reionization process, we also make use of measurements of the
amplitude of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect using additional
information from the high resolution Atacama Cosmology Telescope and South Pole
Telescope experiments. The average redshift at which reionization occurs is
found to lie between z=7.8 and 8.8, depending on the model of reionization
adopted. Using kSZ constraints and a redshift-symmetric reionization model, we
find an upper limit to the width of the reionization period of Dz &lt; 2.8. In all
cases, we find that the Universe is ionized at less than the 10% level at
redshifts above z~10. This suggests that an early onset of reionization is
strongly disfavoured by the Planck data. We show that this result also reduces
the tension between CMB-based analyses and constraints from other astrophysical
sources.

gravitational-wave (GW) emission and outflows with significant kinetic
energies. These outflows result in radio emissions through synchrotron
radiation. We explore the detectability of these synchrotron generated radio
signals by follow-up observations of GW merger events lacking a detection of
electromagnetic counterparts in other wavelengths. We model radio light curves
arising from (i) sub-relativistic merger ejecta and (ii) ultra-relativistic
jets. The former produces radio remnants on timescales of a few years and the
latter produces $\gamma$-ray bursts in the direction of the jet and
orphan-radio afterglows extending over wider angles on timescales of weeks.
Based on the derived light curves, we suggest an optimized survey at $1.4$ GHz
with five epochs separated by a logarithmic time interval. We estimate the
detectability of the radio counterparts of simulated GW-merger events to be
detected by advanced LIGO and Virgo by current and future radio facilities. The
detectable distances for these GW merger events could be as high as 1 Gpc.
$20$--$60\%$ of the long-lasting radio remnants will be detectable in the case
of the moderate kinetic energy of $3\cdot 10^{50}$ erg and a circum-merger
density of $0.1 {\rm cm^{-3}}$ or larger, while $5$--$20\%$ of the orphan radio
afterglows with kinetic energy of $10^{48}$ erg will be detectable. The
detection likelihood increases if one focuses on the well-localizable GW
events. We discuss the background noise due to radio fluxes of host galaxies
and false positives arising from extragalactic radio transients and variable
Active Galactic Nuclei and we show that the quiet radio transient sky is of
great advantage when searching for the radio counterparts.

understand the relationship between the CS properties and those of the

the same technique in different metallicity environments: the Large and Small

resolve these compact PNe and distinguish the CS emission from that of their
surrounding PNe. The targets were imaged through the filters F200LP, F350LP,

bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures using the Zanstra technique,
from a combination of HST photometry and ground-based spectroscopic data. We
present new unique photometric measurements of 50 CSs, and derived effective
temperatures and luminosities for most of them. Central star masses for 23
targets were derived by placing the stars on a temperature-luminosity diagram
and compare their location with the best available single star post-AGB
evolutionary tracks, the remaining masses were indeterminate most likely
because of underestimates of the stellar temperature, or because of substantial
errors in the adopted statistical distances to these objects. The distribution
of CS masses in the sample of compact PNe is different than sample in the LMC

short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in two sub-classes. The ones with
$E_{iso}\lesssim10^{52}$ erg coalesce to form a massive NS and are indicated as
short gamma-ray flashes (S-GRFs). The hardest, with $E_{iso}\gtrsim10^{52}$

(S-GRBs). Within the fireshell model, S-GRBs exhibit three different
components: the P-GRB emission, observed at the transparency of a
self-accelerating baryon-$e^+e^-$ plasma; the prompt emission, originating from
the interaction of the accelerated baryons with the circumburst medium; the
high-energy (GeV) emission, observed after the P-GRB and indicating the
formation of a BH. GRB 090510 gives the first evidence for the formation of a
Kerr BH or, possibly, a Kerr-Newman BH. Its P-GRB spectrum can be fitted by a
convolution of thermal spectra whose origin can be traced back to an axially
symmetric dyadotorus. A large value of the angular momentum of the newborn BH
is consistent with the large energetics of this S-GRB, which reach in the
1--10000 keV range $E_{iso}=(3.95\pm0.21)\times10^{52}$ erg and in the 0.1--100
GeV range $E_{LAT}=(5.78\pm0.60)\times10^{52}$ erg, the most energetic GeV

that we derive from the fireshell theory is consistent with the spectroscopic
measurement $z=0.903\pm0.003$, showing the self-consistency of the theoretical
approach. All S-GRBs exhibit GeV emission, when inside the Fermi-LAT field of

the discriminant for the formation of a BH in GRBs, confirmed by their observed

from soft gamma repeaters. The BAT error circle at 68 per cent confidence range
encloses the point-like X-ray source at the centre of the nebula,
1E161348-5055. Its nature has been long debated due to a periodicity of 6.67 hr
in X-rays, which could indicate either an extremely slow pulsating neutron
star, or the orbital period of a very compact X-ray binary system. We found
that 20 min before the BAT trigger, the soft X-ray emission of 1E161348-5055
was a factor of ~100 higher than measured 2 yr earlier, indicating that an
outburst had already started. By comparing the spectral and timing
characteristics of the source in the two years before the outburst and after
the BAT event, we find that, besides a change in luminosity and spectral shape,
also the 6.67 hr pulsed profile has significantly changed with a clear phase
shift with respect to its low-flux profile. The UV/optical/NIR observations did

so-called growth barriers: the direct growth of larger bodies is halted at
centimetre-sized objects and particular conditions are required for the
formation of larger, gravitationally bound planetesimals. We aim to connect
models of dust evolution and planetesimal formation to identify regions of
protoplanetary discs that are favourable for the formation of kilometre-sized

viscous protoplanetary disc evolution, dust growth and drift including
backreaction of the dust particles on the gas, and planetesimal formation via
the streaming instability into one numerical code. We investigate how
planetesimal formation is affected by the mass of the protoplanetary disc, its
initial dust content, and the stickiness of dust aggregates. We find that the
dust growth and drift leads to a global redistribution of solids. The pile-up
of pebbles in the inner disc provides local conditions where the streaming
instability is effective. Planetesimals form in an annulus with its inner edge
lying between 0.3 AU and 1 AU and its width ranging from 0.3 AU to 3 AU. The

high-energy pulsed emission and particle acceleration in gamma-ray pulsars.
Recent particle-in-cell simulations of pulsar magnetosphere suggest that
high-energy emission results from particles accelerated in the equatorial
current sheet emitting synchrotron radiation. In this study, we re-examine the
simulation data to compute the phase-resolved polarization properties. We find
that the emission is mildly polarized and that there is an anticorrelation
between the flux and the degree of linear polarization (on-pulse: ~15%,
off-pulse: ~30%). The decrease of polarization during pulses is mainly
attributed to the formation of caustics in the current sheet. Each pulse of
light is systematically accompanied by a rapid swing of the polarization angle
due to the change of the magnetic polarity when the line of sight passes
through the current sheet. The optical polarization pattern observed in the
Crab can be well-reproduced for a pulsar inclination angle ~60 degrees and an
observer viewing angle ~130 degrees. The predicted high-energy polarization is
a robust feature of the current sheet emitting scenario which can be tested by
future X-ray and gamma-ray polarimetry instruments.

solar telescope and the FTS at the Institut f\"ur Astrophysik G\"ottingen, 76
spectra were taken during partial solar eclipse. We obtained RVs using $I_2$ as
wavelength reference and determined the RM curve with a peak-to-peak amplitude
of almost 1.4 km s$^{-1}$ at typical RV precision better than 1 m s$^{-1}$. We
modeled disk-integrated solar RVs using surface velocities, limb darkening, and
information about convective blueshift from 3D magneto-hydrodynamic
simulations. We confirm that convective blueshift is crucial to understand
solar RVs during eclipse. Our best model reproduced the observations to within
a relative precision of 10% with residuals less than 30 m s$^{-1}$. We
cross-checked parameterizations of velocity fields using a Dopplergram from the
Solar Dynamics Observatory and conclude that disk-integration of the
Dopplergram does not provide correct information about convective blueshift
necessary for m s$^{-1}$ RV work. As main limitation for modeling RVs during
eclipses, we identified limited knowledge about convective blueshift and line
shape as functions of solar limb angle. We suspect that our model line profiles
are too shallow at limb angles larger than $\mu = 0.6$ resulting in incorrect
weighting of the velocities across the solar disk. Alternative explanations
cannot be excluded like suppression of convection in magnetic areas and
undiscovered systematics during eclipse observations. Accurate observations of
solar line profiles across the solar disk are suggested. We publish our RVs
taken during solar eclipse as a benchmark curve for codes calculating the RM
effect and for models of solar surface velocities and line profiles.

based on the theory of inclusive breakup reactions commonly employed in the
treatment of incomplete fusion and surrogate method. The theory was developed

the fragment yield in the reaction $A\,(a,b)\,X$, where the projectile is $a =
x_1 + x_2 + b$. The inclusive breakup cross section is found to be the sum of a
generalized four-body form of the elastic breakup cross section plus the
inclusive non-elastic breakup cross section which involves the "reaction" cross
section of the participant fragments, $x_1$ and $x_2$. The final result is
similar to the three-body case reviewed in Austern, et al. (Phys. Rep.
\textbf{154}, 125 (1987)), \cite{Austern1987}, but with important genuine
four-body effects added, both in the elastic breakup cross section, which now
contains the full correlations between the participant fragments, and in the
inclusive non- elastic breakup. These developments should encourage
experimentalists to seek more information about the $x_{1} + x_{2}$ system in
the elastic breakup cross section, and to theorists to further develop and

The decay process has an advantage of being free from meson resonances in the

collisions plants a seed of positive (negative) magnetic helicity in the
hemisphere above (below) the reaction plane. Owing to the chiral anomaly, the
magnetic helicity interacts with the fermionic helicity of the collision
system, and causes photons emitted in upper- and lower-hemispheres to have
different preferences in the circular polarization. In this paper, we lay down
a procedure to measure the variation of the circular polarization w.r.t the
reaction plane in relativistic heavy-ion collisions for massless photons, as
well as similar polarization patterns for vector mesons decaying into two

involving weakly bound three-cluster nuclei. Borromean, two-nucleon, halo
nuclei are candidates of unstable three-fragments projectiles. The model is
based on the theory of inclusive breakup reactions commonly employed in the
treatment of incomplete fusion and surrogate method. The theory was developed
in the 80's by Ichimura, Autern and Vincent (IAV) [Phys. Rev. C 32, 431 (1985)]
\cite{IAV1985}, Udagawa and Tamura (UT)[Phys. Rev. C 24, 1348 (1981)],
\cite{UT1981} and Hussein and McVoy (HM)[Nucl. Phys. A 445, 124 (1985)],
\cite{HM1985}. We extend these three-body theories to derive an expression for
the fragment yield in the reaction $A\,(a,b)\,X$, where the projectile is $a =
x_1 + x_2 + b$. The inclusive breakup cross section is found to be the sum of a
generalized four-body form of the elastic breakup cross section plus the
inclusive non-elastic breakup cross section which involves the "reaction" cross
section of the participant fragments, $x_1$ and $x_2$. The final result is
similar to the three-body case reviewed in Austern, et al. (Phys. Rep.
\textbf{154}, 125 (1987)), \cite{Austern1987}, but with important genuine
four-body effects added, both in the elastic breakup cross section, which now
contains the full correlations between the participant fragments, and in the
inclusive non- elastic breakup. These developments should encourage
experimentalists to seek more information about the $x_{1} + x_{2}$ system in
the elastic breakup cross section, and to theorists to further develop and
extend the surrogate method, based on the inclusive non-elastic breakup part of
the $b$ spectrum.

state energy and for computing low energy states of quantum impurity models.
Such models describe a bath of free fermions coupled to a small interacting
subsystem called an impurity. The full system consists of $n$ fermionic modes
and has a Hamiltonian $H=H_0+H_{imp}$, where $H_0$ is quadratic in
creation-annihilation operators and $H_{imp}$ is an arbitrary Hamiltonian
acting on a subset of $O(1)$ modes. We show that the ground energy of $H$ can
be approximated with an additive error $2^{-b}$ in time $n^3 \exp{[O(b^3)]}$.
Our algorithm also finds a low energy state that achieves this approximation.
The low energy state is represented as a superposition of $\exp{[O(b^3)]}$
fermionic Gaussian states. To arrive at this result we prove several theorems
concerning exact ground states of impurity models. In particular, we show that
eigenvalues of the ground state covariance matrix decay exponentially with the
exponent depending very mildly on the spectral gap of $H_0$. A key ingredient
of our proof is Zolotarev's rational approximation to the $\sqrt{x}$ function.
We anticipate that our algorithms may be used in hybrid quantum-classical
simulations of strongly correlated materials based on dynamical mean field
theory. We implemented a simplified practical version of our algorithm and
benchmarked it using the single impurity Anderson model.

$L_\infty[1]$-algebras. We extract an intrinsic character, the Atiyah class,
when a smaller $L_\infty[1]$-algebra $A$ is extended to a bigger one $L$. In
fact, we establish that given such an SH Lie pair $(L,A)$, and any $A$-module
$E$, there associates a canonical cohomology class, the Atiyah class
$[\alpha^E]$, living in $H^2_{\mathrm{CE}}(A,A^\perp \otimes End(E))$, which
generalizes earlier known Atiyah classes out of Lie algebra pairs. In
particular, the quotient space $L/A$ is a canonical $A$-module and there
associates the Atiyah class $[\alpha^{L/A}]\in H^2_{\mathrm{CE}}(A,Hom(L/A

$H^\bullet_{\mathrm{CE}}(A,L/A[-2])$ a Lie algebra structure, and on
$H^\bullet_{\mathrm{CE}}(A,E[-2])$ a Lie algebra module structure. An
alternative point of view is that the process of taking Atiyah classes defines
a functor from the category of $A$-modules to the category of

gauge theories. In this context, confined phases with strongly fluctuating
gauge fields seem to be irrelevant to the physics of topological phases. For
example, the low-energy theory of the two-dimensional (2D) toric code model
(i.e. the deconfined phase of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory) is a $U(1)\times
U(1)$ Chern-Simons theory in which gauge charges (i.e., $e$ and $m$ particles)
are deconfined and the gauge fields are gapped, while the confined phase is
topologically trivial. In this paper, we point out a new route to constructing
exotic 3D gapped fermionic phases in a confining phase of a gauge theory.
Starting from a parton construction with strongly fluctuating compact
$U(1)\times U(1)$ gauge fields, we construct gapped phases of interacting
fermions by condensing two linearly independent bosonic composite particles
consisting of partons and $U(1)\times U(1)$ magnetic monopoles. This can be
regarded as a 3D generalization of the 2D Bais-Slingerland condensation
mechanism. Charge fractionalization results from a Debye-H\"uckel-like
screening cloud formed by the condensed composite particles. Within our general
framework, we explore two aspects of symmetry-enriched 3D Abelian topological
phases. First, we construct a new fermionic state of matter with time-reversal
symmetry and $\Theta\neq \pi$, the fractional topological insulator. Second, we
generalize the notion of anyonic symmetry of 2D Abelian topological phases to
the charge-loop excitation symmetry ($\mathsf{Charles}$) of 3D Abelian
topological phases. We show that line twist defects, which realize
$\mathsf{Charles}$ transformations, exhibit non-Abelian fusion properties.

on a general formulation of the Floquet theory relying on the extended Hilbert
space. In addition to a fast periodic modulation we allow the Hamiltonian to
have an extra (slow) time-dependence. The dynamics of the system can then be
described in terms of a slowly varying effective Floquet Hamiltonian that
captures the long-term evolution, as well as rapidly oscillating micromotion
operators. We obtain a systematic high-frequency expansion of all these
operators. In contrast to the previous studies, the expanded effective
Hamiltonian is now time-dependent and contains extra terms reflecting the
modulation of the periodic Hamiltonian. The same applies to the micromotion
operators which exhibit a slow temporal dependence in addition to the rapid
oscillations. As an illustration, we consider a quantum-mechanical spin in an
oscillating magnetic field with a slowly changing direction. The effective
evolution of the spin is then associated with non-Abelian geometric phases if
the oscillations of the magnetic field go beyond a single plane. The developed
formalism is general and can also be applied to other periodically driven

Our algorithm also finds a low energy state that achieves this approximation.
The low energy state is represented as a superposition of $\exp{[O(b^3)]}$

correlation, it turns out a quantum state with minimal size that is able to
produce this correlation can always be pure. In this work, we first exhibit two
characterizations for the pure state that Alice and Bob share using only the
correlation data. Specifically, we give two conditions that the Schmidt
coefficients must satisfy, which have very broad applications in many quantum
tasks. First, one of the characterizations allows us to bound the entanglement
between Alice and Bob using Renyi entropies and also to estimate the underlying
Hilbert space dimension. Second, we provide examples to show that our results
can be tight, where the shared quantum state is characterized completely. In
this situation, our result serves as a general theoretical tool to self-test
bipartite pure quantum states in a device-independent manner. Third, the second
characterization gives a sufficient condition that a Bell correlation cannot be
generated by maximally entangled states of certain dimension. We also show that
our results can be generalized to the case of shared mixed states.

information scrambling -- are found to be intimately related to each other.
Here we report the measurement of OTOCs of an Ising spin chain on a nuclear

differently in the integrable and chaotic cases. Based on the recent discovered
relationship between OTOCs and the growth of entanglement entropy in the

particles is presented. The model consists of a finite collection of modes that
can be occupied by N particles, either bosons or fermions. Measurement
scenarios allow one to measure occupation of each mode in at least two
different measurement contexts. The system is said to be non-contextual if the
occupation numbers can be assigned to modes in each measurement scenario. The
assignment is done under the non-contextuality assumption, i.e., an occupation
number assigned to a mode does not depend on a scenario in which this mode is
measured. In addition, the total number of particles has to be conserved,
therefore the sum of occupation numbers in each measurement context is equal to
N. For N=1 the model does not differ from the standard contextuality scenario.
However, for N&gt;1 the problem reveals new complex features. In particular, it is
shown that a type of contextuality exhibited by the system (state-dependent,

on a general formulation of the Floquet theory relying on the extended Hilbert
space. In addition to a fast periodic modulation we allow the Hamiltonian to
have an extra (slow) time-dependence. The dynamics of the system can then be
described in terms of a slowly varying effective Floquet Hamiltonian that
captures the long-term evolution, as well as rapidly oscillating micromotion
operators. We obtain a systematic high-frequency expansion of all these
operators. In contrast to the previous studies, the expanded effective
Hamiltonian is now time-dependent and contains extra terms reflecting the
modulation of the periodic Hamiltonian. The same applies to the micromotion
operators which exhibit a slow temporal dependence in addition to the rapid
oscillations. As an illustration, we consider a quantum-mechanical spin in an
oscillating magnetic field with a slowly changing direction. The effective
evolution of the spin is then associated with non-Abelian geometric phases if
the oscillations of the magnetic field go beyond a single plane. The developed

with strong bundling, it becomes hard to identify origins and destinations of
individual edges. We propose a solution: we optimize edge coloring to
differentiate bundled edges. We quantify strength of bundling in a flexible
pairwise fashion between edges, and among bundled edges, we quantify how
dissimilar their colors should be by dissimilarity of their origins and
destinations. We solve the resulting nonlinear optimization, which is also
interpretable as a novel dimensionality reduction task. In large graphs the
necessary compromise is whether to differentiate colors sharply between locally
occurring strongly bundled edges ("local bundles"), or also between the weakly
bundled edges occurring globally over the graph ("global bundles"); we allow a
user-set global-local tradeoff. We call the technique "peacock bundles".
Experiments show the coloring clearly enhances comprehensibility of graph

need to interact with an external database to access real-world knowledge (e.g.

However, such symbolic operations break the differentiability of the system and
prevent end-to-end training of neural dialogue agents. In this paper, we
address this limitation by replacing symbolic queries with an induced "soft"

indeed the case in estimation theory where classical tools to quantify
performance of an estimator are tightly related to the assumption of finite
variance variables. In alpha-stable environments, expressions such as the mean
square error and the Cramer-Rao bound are hence problematic. In this work, we
tackle the parameter estimation problem in impulsive noise environments and
develop novel tools that are tailored to the alpha-stable and heavy-tailed
noise environments, tools that coincide with the standard ones adopted in the
Gaussian setup, namely a generalized "power" measure and a generalized Fisher
information. We generalize known information inequalities commonly used in the
Gaussian context: the de Bruijn's identity, the data processing inequality, the
Fisher information inequality, the isoperimetric inequality for entropies and
the Cramer-Rao bound. Additionally, we derive upper bounds on the differential
entropy of independent sums having a stable component. Finally, the new "power"
measure is used to shed some light on the additive alpha-stable noise channel
capacity in a setup that generalizes the linear average power constrained AWGN
channel. Our theoretical findings are paralleled with numerical evaluations of
various quantities and bounds using developed {\em Matlab} packages.

(modules) driven by external excitation and disturbance signals. In order to
identify their dynamical properties and/or their topology consistently from
measured data, we need to make sure that the network model set is identifiable.
We introduce the notion of network identifiability, as a property of a
parameterized model set, that ensures that module dynamics are uniquely related
to the objects that can be uniquely estimated from data. In the classical
prediction error framework, these objects are the predictor filters that
constitute the one-step ahead output predictors. We generalize this situation
to include the option of having noise-free node signals. The results can be
used to specify which presence of excitation signals will result in a unique
representation of the network dynamics in a particular network model
parametrization. This uniqueness is necessary for detecting the topology of the
network from measured data, and for consistently estimating the network
dynamics. We combine aspects of the classical notion of system identifiability
with a uniqueness-oriented parametrization concept, and extend this to the
situation of highly structured model sets. All node signals in the network are
treated in a symmetric way as both inputs and outputs. The presented concepts
and theory allow for the incorporation of particular structural prior knowledge
of the network structure.

estimation in multi-systems. Suppose there are $\mathtt{M}$ independent
systems, each of which has a remote sensor monitoring the system and sending
its local estimates to a fusion center over a packet-dropping channel. An
attacker may generate noises to exacerbate the communication channels between
sensors and the fusion center. Due to capacity limitation, at each time the
attacker can exacerbate at most $\mathtt{N}$ of the $\mathtt{M}$ channels. The
goal of the attacker side is to seek an optimal policy maximizing the
estimation error at the fusion center. The problem is formulated as a Markov
decision process (MDP) problem, and the existence of an optimal deterministic
and stationary policy is proved. We further show that the optimal policy has a
threshold structure, by which the computational complexity is reduced
significantly. Based on the threshold structure, a myopic policy is proposed
for homogeneous models and its optimality is established. To overcome the curse
of dimensionality of MDP algorithms for general heterogeneous models, we

and develop a distributed power control mechanism for the relaying terminals.
Unlike prior art which mainly deal with single-relay systems with saturated
traffic flow, we address the case of bursty data arrival at the source
cooperatively forwarded by multiple half-duplex EH relays. We aim at optimizing
the long-run average delay of the source packets under the energy neutrality
constraint on power consumption of each relay. While EH relay systems have been
predominantly optimized using either offline or online methodologies, we take
on a more realistic learning-theoretic approach. Hence, our scheme can be
deployed for real-time operation without assuming acausal information on
channel realizations, data/energy arrivals as required by offline optimization,
nor does it rely on precise statistics of the system processes as is the case
with online optimization. We formulate the problem as a partially observable
identical payoff stochastic game (PO-IPSG) with factored controllers, in which
the power control policy of each relay is adaptive to its local
source-to-relay/relay-to-destination channel states, its local energy state as
well as to the source buffer state information. We derive a multi-agent
reinforcement learning algorithm which is convergent to a locally optimal
solution of the formulated PO-IPSG. The proposed algorithm operates without
explicit message exchange between the relays, while inducing only little
source-relay signaling overhead. By simulation, we contrast the delay
performance of the proposed method against existing heuristics for throughput
maximization. It is shown that compared with these heuristics, the systematic
approach adopted in this paper has a smaller sub-optimality gap once evaluated
against a centralized optimal policy armed with perfect statistics.

institutions but also to the nation. This criminal activity is becoming more
and more sophisticated and seems to have moved from the clichy of drug
trafficking to financing terrorism and surely not forgetting personal gain.
Most international financial institutions have been implementing anti-money
laundering solutions to fight investment fraud. However, traditional
investigative techniques consume numerous man-hours. Recently, data mining
approaches have been developed and are considered as well-suited techniques for
detecting money laundering activities. Within the scope of a collaboration
project for the purpose of developing a new solution for the anti-money
laundering Units in an international investment bank, we proposed a simple and
efficient data mining-based solution for anti-money laundering. In this paper,
we present this solution developed as a tool and show some preliminary
experiment results with real transaction datasets.

day coming from a large variety of sources. People and co-operations are
producing data on a large scale, and since the rise of the internet, e-mail and
social media the amount of produced data has grown exponentially. From a law
enforcement perspective we have to deal with these huge amounts of data when a
criminal investigation is launched against an individual or company. Relevant
questions need to be answered like who committed the crime, who were involved,
what happened and on what time, who were communicating and about what? Not only
the amount of available data to investigate has increased enormously, but also
the complexity of this data has increased. When these communication patterns
need to be combined with for instance a seized financial administration or
corporate document shares a complex investigation problem arises. Recently,
criminal investigators face a huge challenge when evidence of a crime needs to
be found in the Big Data environment where they have to deal with large and
complex datasets especially in financial and fraud investigations. To tackle
this problem, a financial and fraud investigation unit of a European country
has developed a new tool named LES that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques to help criminal investigators handle large amounts of textual
information in a more efficient and faster way. In this paper, we present
briefly this tool and we focus on the evaluation its performance in terms of
the requirements of forensic investigation: speed, smarter and easier for
investigators. In order to evaluate this LES tool, we use different performance
metrics. We also show experimental results of our evaluation with large and
complex datasets from real-world application.

estimation is introduced. The measure is defined to be the conditional
probability that an external observer assigns to the private nodes in the
transportation network, e.g., location of home or office, given all the
position measurements that it broadcasts over time. An algorithm for finding an
optimal trade-off between the measure of privacy infringement and the expected
estimation error, captured by the number of the nodes over which the
participant stops broadcasting its position, is proposed. The algorithm
searches over a family of policies in which an agent stops transmitting its
position measurements if its distance (in terms of the number of hops) to the
privacy sensitive node is smaller than a prescribed threshold. Employing such
symmetric policies are advantageous in terms of the resources required for
implementation and the ease of computation. The results are expanded to more
general policies. Further, the effect of the heterogeneity of the population
density on the optimal policy is explored. Finally, the relationship between
the betweenness measure of centrality and the optimal privacy-preserving policy

using simple gradient-based methods, most existing theoretical results are
negative, showing that learning such networks is difficult, in a worst-case
sense over all data distributions. In this paper, we take a more nuanced view,
and consider whether specific assumptions on the "niceness" of the input
distribution, or "niceness" of the target function (e.g. in terms of
smoothness, non-degeneracy, incoherence, random choice of parameters etc.), are
sufficient to guarantee learnability using gradient-based methods. We provide
evidence that neither class of assumptions alone is sufficient: For any member
of a class of "nice" simple target functions, there are difficult input
distributions, and on the other hand, for any member of a general class of
"nice" input distributions, there are simple target functions which are
difficult to learn. Thus, to formally explain the practical success of neural
network learning, it seems that one would need to employ a careful combination
of assumptions on both the input distribution and the target function. To prove
our results, we develop some tools which may be of independent interest, such

the English text symbol sequence originally used to illustrate the theory by a

derive a new and symmetric version of the second order entropy in 1D. The new
theory then naturally extends to 2D and higher dimensions, where by naturally
we mean simple, symmetric, isotropic and parsimonious. Simplicity arises from
the direct application of Shannon's joint entropy equalities and inequalities
to the gradient (del) vector field image embodying the second order relations
of the scalar image. Parsimony is guaranteed by halving of the vector data rate
using Papoulis' generalized sampling expansion. The new 2D entropy measure,
which we dub delentropy, is underpinned by a computable probability density
function we call deldensity. The deldensity captures the underlying spatial
image structure and pixel co-occurrence. It achieves this because each scalar
image pixel value is nonlocally related to the entire gradient vector field.
Both deldensity and delentropy are highly tractable and yield many interesting
connections and useful inequalities. The new measure explicitly defines a
realizable encoding algorithm and a corresponding reconstruction. Initial tests
show that delentropy compares favourably with the conventional intensity-based
histogram entropy and the compressed data rates of lossless image encoders
(GIF, PNG, WEBP, JP2K-LS and JPG-LS) for a selection of images. The symmetric
approach may have applications to higher dimensions and problems concerning

coordinates can be repaired by accessing at most $r$ other coordinates. When
some of the $r$ coordinates are also erased, the $r$-local LRC can not
accomplish the local repair, which leads to the concept of
$(r,\delta)$-locality. A $q$-ary $[n, k]$ linear code $\cC$ is said to have
$(r, \delta)$-locality ($\delta\ge 2$) if for each coordinate $i$, there exists
a punctured subcode of $\cC$ with support containing $i$, whose length is at
most $r + \delta - 1$, and whose minimum distance is at least $\delta$. The
$(r, \delta)$-LRC can tolerate $\delta-1$ erasures in total, which degenerates
to a $r$-local LRC when $\delta=2$. A $q$-ary $(r,\delta)$ LRC is called
optimal if it meets the Singleton-like bound for $(r,\delta)$-LRCs. A class of
optimal $q$-ary cyclic $r$-local LRCs with lengths $n\mid q-1$ were constructed
by Tamo, Barg, Goparaju and Calderbank based on the $q$-ary Reed-Solomon codes.
In this paper, we construct a class of optimal $q$-ary cyclic $(r,\delta)$-LRCs
($\delta\ge 2$) with length $n\mid q-1$, which generalizes the results of Tamo
\emph{et al.} Moreover, we construct a new class of optimal $q$-ary cyclic
$r$-local LRCs with lengths $n\mid q+1$ and a new class of optimal $q$-ary
cyclic $(r,\delta)$-LRCs ($\delta\ge 2$) with lengths $n\mid q+1$. The
constructed optimal LRCs with length $n=q+1$ have the best-known length $q+1$

to promptly vacate the channel can introduce significant access-latency for
primary or high-priority users (PU). In conventional cognitive radio systems,
the backoff latency is exacerbated by frame structures that only allow sensing
at periodic intervals. Concurrent transmission and sensing using
self-interference suppression has been suggested to improve the performance of
cognitive radio systems, allowing decisions to be taken at multiple points
within the frame. In this paper, we extend this approach by proposing a
sliding-window full-duplex model allowing decisions to be taken on a
sample-by-sample basis. We also derive the access-latency for both the existing
and the proposed schemes. Our results show that the access-latency of the
sliding scheme is decreased by a factor of 2.6 compared to the existing slotted
full-duplex scheme and by a factor of approximately 16 compared to a
half-duplex cognitive radio system. Moreover, the proposed scheme is
significantly more resilient to the destructive effects of residual
self-interference compared to previous approaches.

They were also used in the constructions of DES-like iterated ciphers,
error-correcting codes, and codebooks. They were originally defined only in
finite fields with odd characteristic, but recently Zhou introduced
pesudo-planar functions in even characteristic which yields similar
applications. All known pesudo-planar functions are quadratic and hence they
give presemifields. In this paper, a new approach to constructing quadratic
pseudo-planar functions is given. Then five explicit families of pseudo-planar
functions are constructed, one of which is a binomial, two of which are
trinomials, and the other two are quadrinomials. All known pesudo-planar
functions are revisited, some of which are generalized. These functions not
only lead to projective planes, relative difference sets and presemifields, but
also give optimal codebooks meeting the Levenstein bound, complete sets of
mutually unbiased bases (MUB) and compressed sensing matrices with low

Informally, the breakdown point is the minimum fraction of data points which if

learning and parsing (TLP) of unknown objects in video sequences with a
hierarchical and compositional And-Or graph (AOG) representation. %The AOG
captures both structural and appearance variations of a target object in a
principled way. The TLP method is formulated in the Bayesian framework with a
spatial and a temporal dynamic programming (DP) algorithms inferring object
bounding boxes on-the-fly. During online learning, the AOG is discriminatively
learned using latent SVM to account for appearance (e.g., lighting and partial
occlusion) and structural (e.g., different poses and viewpoints) variations of
a tracked object, as well as distractors (e.g., similar objects) in background.
Three key issues in online inference and learning are addressed: (i)
maintaining purity of positive and negative examples collected online, (ii)
controling model complexity in latent structure learning, and (iii) identifying
critical moments to re-learn the structure of AOG based on its intrackability.
The intrackability measures uncertainty of an AOG based on its score maps in a
frame. In experiments, our AOGTracker is tested on two popular tracking
benchmarks with the same parameter setting: the TB-100/50/CVPR2013 benchmarks,
and the VOT benchmarks --- VOT 2013, 2014, 2015 and TIR2015 (thermal imagery
tracking). In the former, our AOGTracker outperforms state-of-the-art tracking
algorithms including two trackers based on deep convolutional network. In the
latter, our AOGTracker outperforms all other trackers in VOT2013 and is
comparable to the state-of-the-art methods in VOT2014, 2015 and TIR2015.

represent interactive computational problems, and their "truth" is understood
as existence of an algorithmic solution. Various complexity constraints on such
solutions induce various versions of clarithmetic. The present paper introduces
a parameterized/schematic version CLA11(P1,P2,P3,P4). By tuning the three
parameters P1,P2,P3 in an essentially mechanical manner, one automatically
obtains sound and complete theories with respect to a wide range of target
tricomplexity classes, i.e. combinations of time (set by P3), space (set by P2)
and so called amplitude (set by P1) complexities. Sound in the sense that every
theorem T of the system represents an interactive number-theoretic
computational problem with a solution from the given tricomplexity class and,
furthermore, such a solution can be automatically extracted from a proof of T.
And complete in the sense that every interactive number-theoretic problem with
a solution from the given tricomplexity class is represented by some theorem of
the system. Furthermore, through tuning the 4th parameter P4, at the cost of
sacrificing recursive axiomatizability but not simplicity or elegance, the
above extensional completeness can be strengthened to intensional completeness,
according to which every formula representing a problem with a solution from
the given tricomplexity class is a theorem of the system. This article is
published in two parts. The present Part I introduces the system and proves its
completeness, while Part II is devoted to proving soundness.

is to exploit the rich relational data in digital social networks (the social

distributed computing systems for this purpose. Distributing graph processing
requires solving many difficult engineering problems, which has lead some
researchers to look at single-machine solutions that are faster and easier to

large-scale graph processing that allows analysts to interactively explore
graph structures. The key idea is that the aggregate actions of large numbers
of users can be compressed into a data structure that encapsulates user
similarities while being robust to noise and queryable in real-time. We achieve
single machine real-time performance by compressing the neighbourhood of each
vertex using minhash signatures and facilitate rapid queries through Locality
Sensitive Hashing. These techniques reduce query times from hours using
industrial desktop machines operating on the full graph to milliseconds on
standard laptops. Our method allows exploration of strongly associated regions
(i.e. communities) of large graphs in real-time on a laptop. It has been

neural networks is maximized on the so-called "edge of criticality". Once the
network operates in this configuration, it performs efficiently on a specific
application both in terms of (i) low prediction error and (ii) high short-term
memory capacity. Since the behavior of recurrent networks is strongly
influenced by the particular input signal driving the dynamics, a universal,
application-independent method for determining the edge of criticality is still
missing. In this paper, we aim at addressing this issue by proposing a
theoretically motivated, unsupervised method based on Fisher information for
determining the edge of criticality in recurrent neural networks. It is proven
that Fisher information is maximized for (finite-size) systems operating in
such critical regions. However, Fisher information is notoriously difficult to
compute and either requires the probability density function or the conditional
dependence of the system states with respect to the model parameters. The paper
takes advantage of a recently-developed non-parametric estimator of the Fisher
information matrix and provides a method to determine the critical region of
echo state networks, a particular class of recurrent networks. The considered
control parameters, which indirectly affect the echo state network performance,
are explored to identify those configurations lying on the edge of criticality
and, as such, maximizing Fisher information and computational performance.
Experimental results on benchmarks and real-world data demonstrate the

the Maximum over Positive Hypergraphs (MPH) hierarchy [FFIILS15], where the

They
can be studied via a plethora of models, depending on the specific details of
the phenomena under study. Disease contagion and rumor spreading are among the
most important of these processes due to their practical relevance. However,
despite the similarities between them, current models address both spreading
dynamics separately. In this paper, we propose a general information spreading
model that is based on discrete time Markov chains. The model includes all the
transitions that are plausible for both a disease contagion process and rumor
propagation. We show that our model not only covers the traditional spreading
schemes, but that it also contains some features relevant in social dynamics,
such as apathy, forgetting, and lost/recovering of interest. The model is
evaluated analytically to obtain the spreading thresholds and the early time
dynamical behavior for the contact and reactive processes in several scenarios.
Comparison with Monte Carlo simulations shows that the Markov chain formalism
is highly accurate while it excels in computational efficiency. We round off
our work by showing how the proposed framework can be applied to the study of
spreading processes occurring on social networks.

phones or on desktops. End users of these applications range from novice to
expert depending on how experienced they are in using them. With repeated usage
(practice) of an application, a user's think time gradually decreases, known as
learning phenomenon. In contrast to the popular notion of constant mean think
time of users across all practice sessions, decrease in mean think time over
practice sessions does occur due to learning. This decrease gives rise to a
different system workload thereby affecting the application's short-term
performance. However, such impact of learning on performance has never been
accounted for. In this work we propose a model that accounts for human learning
behavior in analyzing the transient (short-term) performance of a 3-tier cloud
based application. Our approach is based on a closed queueing network model. We
solve the model using discrete event simulation. In addition to the overall
mean System Response Time (SRT), our model solution also generates the mean
SRTs for various types (novice, intermediate, expert) of requests submitted by
users at various levels of their expertise. We demonstrate that our model can
be used to evaluate various what-if scenarios to decide the number of VMs we
need for each tier-a VM configuration-that would meet the response time SLA.
The results show that the lack of accountability of learning may lead to a
selection of an inappropriate VM configuration. The results further show that
the mean SRTs for various types of requests are better measures to consider in
VM allocation process in comparison to the overall mean SRT.

Multi-label classification problems is proposed and discussed. In multi-label

are the subset of the multi-label problem with the number of labels

the single-label problem, both the number of labels the sample belongs to, and
each of those target labels are to be identified for multi-label classification

classifier for real-time data streams is proposed. Multi-label classification
is one of the actively researched machine learning paradigm that has gained
much attention in the recent years due to its rapidly increasing real world
applications. In contrast to traditional binary and multi-class classification,
multi-label classification involves association of each of the input samples
with a set of target labels simultaneously. There are no real-time online
neural network based multi-label classifier available in the literature. In
this paper, we exploit the inherent nature of high speed exhibited by the
extreme learning machines to develop a novel online real-time classifier for
multi-label data streams. The developed classifier is experimented with
datasets from different application domains for consistency, performance and
speed. The experimental studies show that the proposed method outperforms the
existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of speed and accuracy and can

network structure gets remodeled automatically by facilitating new neurons and
interconnections, and the parameters are calculated in such a way that it
retains the knowledge learnt thus far. This technique is suitable for
real-world applications where the number of classes is often unknown and online

This month, the group voted to propose the Anthropocene as the Holocene's successor, with its start at the industrial boom that followed World War II. Before a formal submission can go to the International Commission on Stratigraphy, the bureaucracy that governs geologic time, researchers must still identify a stratigraphic section rich in geochemical markers of this postwar transition. They have a high bar to clear: Many stratigraphers are skeptical of their initiative and fear being drawn into a political statement.

Nearly 5 years ago the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) endorsed National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommendations that pediatricians draw blood from all 9- to 11-year-olds and test their cholesterol levels. In strongly worded comments, several physicians welcomed the conclusions of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and upbraided AAP for a position whose health benefits they consider inadequate to justify the medical risks and financial costs of cholesterol screening in all kids. AAP representatives say they stand by screening, although they acknowledge the unknowns.

The study provoked controversy when it was first published, with some complaining that it unfairly held the fossil fuel industry responsible for the lifestyle choices made by billions of consumers. Others, however, saw it as a turning point in the debate about apportioning responsibility for climate change. Now, Heede's carbon accounting is opening a new chapter in climate change litigation and policy, helping equip plaintiffs who believe they have suffered damages from climate change to claim compensation.

But more recently, scientists have discovered that a strain named genotype 3 is a problem in Western countries as well, especially in Europe. An estimated 300,000 people get infected annually in Germany alone, and although the vast majority clears the infection easily and without symptoms, the virus persists in the liver of people with weakened immune systems, eventually killing them. Some people get infected through blood donations, but most infections come from eating contaminated pork. The big question now is how the hepatitis E virus can be stopped.

Thus, if the organization gives the product away for free, a substantial amount may be wasted.

This interaction results from large-scale, slowly moving extratropical storms but also from smaller, intense weather systems such as tropical cyclones (called hurricanes in the Atlantic and eastern Pacific, and typhoons in the western Pacific). These are smaller storms, often travel much faster, and have steeper atmospheric pressure gradients that produce very strong winds. All storm systems generate various types of microseisms, which have been studied extensively. A special case of fast-developing, small, extratropical storms in which the central pressure intensifies rapidly, dropping by more than 1 mbar/hour for 24 hours, is called a weather bomb (1). On page 919 of this issue, Nishida and Takagi (2) report on the detection of previously unobserved S wave microseisms generated under a weather bomb between Greenland and Iceland.

Three prolyl hydroxylases target the HIF molecules, EglN1 (PHD2), EglN2 (PHD1), and EglN3 (PHD3) (1). All three are widely expressed iron (Fe++) and -ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. When the oxygen tension is normal, they hydroxylate HIF1 and HIF2. Hydroxylated HIF molecules are recognized and ubiquitinated by an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex containing the von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor protein pVHL (1), leading to their proteasomal degradation. Inactivation of prolyl hydroxylases during hypoxia results in the stabilization of HIF molecules. On page 929 of this issue, Guo et al. present evidence that a prolyl hydroxylation-dependent pathway also plays an important role in the regulation of the Akt kinase, which in turn is a key player in oncogenesis (2).

With so little progress made toward finding a cureor, better, a preventionit is time to rethink the path to progress. This requires a change in perspective on the type of research that will make a difference. The lesson learned from cancer research is that a new commitment means rethinking the fundamental approach to the disease. Cancer research moved from taking potshots with, usually, cytotoxic drugs to a bottom-up, mechanism-based approach in which newly acquired genetic knowledge played the largest role. Today, that effort has produced a platform of knowledge from which academia and industry are drawing. For neurodegenerative disease, the genetic approach remains valid but the problem must concurrently be approached from a complementary, robust cell biological perspective, focusing on the cellular cascade of events that lead to neuronal cell death.

This will be only the fourth health issue (and the first One Health issue, integrating human, animal, and environmental health) to bring together heads of state at the UNGA for a rare opportunity to set a global agenda to combat the crisis. We believe that (i) setting targets for reducing drug-resistant infections, (ii) adequate financing for global action, and (iii) defining the global health architecture to address AMR should be elements of a UN plan.

The properties of materials assembled of QDs may be tailored not only by the atomic composition but also by the size, shape, and surface functionalization of the individual QDs and by the communication among these QDs. The chemical and physical properties of QD surfaces and the interfaces in QD devices are of particular importance, and these enable the solution-based fabrication of low-cost, large-area, flexible, and functional devices. We discuss challenges that must be addressed in the move to solution-processed functional optoelectronic nanomaterials.

Null mutants of super-rogue psbA4 genes, divergent paralogs of psbA genes encoding the D1 core subunit of photosystem II, abolished Chl f synthesis in two cyanobacteria that grow in far-red light. Heterologous expression of the psbA4 gene, which we rename chlF, enables Chl f biosynthesis in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. Because the reaction requires light, Chl f synthase is probably a photo-oxidoreductase that employs catalytically useful Chl a molecules, tyrosine YZ, and plastoquinone (as does photosystem II) but lacks a Mn4Ca1O5 cluster. Introduction of Chl f biosynthesis into crop plants could expand their ability to use solar energy.

Retinol-binding protein (RBP) is the sole specific carrier in the bloodstream for hydrophobic retinol, the main form in which vitamin A is transported. The integral membrane receptor STRA6 mediates cellular uptake of vitamin A by recognizing RBP-retinol to trigger release and internalization of retinol. We present the structure of zebrafish STRA6 determined to 3.9-angstrom resolution by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. STRA6 has one intramembrane and nine transmembrane helices in an intricate dimeric assembly. Unexpectedly, calmodulin is bound tightly to STRA6 in a noncanonical arrangement. Residues involved with RBP binding map to an archlike structure that covers a deep lipophilic cleft. This cleft is open to the membrane, suggesting a possible mode for internalization of retinol through direct diffusion into the lipid bilayer.

However, the mere 320-day half-life of berkeliums only available isotope, 249Bk, has hindered in-depth studies of the elements coordination chemistry. Herein, we report the synthesis and detailed solid-state and solution-phase characterization of a berkelium coordination complex, Bk(III)tris(dipicolinate), as well as a chemically distinct Bk(III) borate material for comparison. We demonstrate that berkeliums complexation is analogous to that of californium. However, from a range of spectroscopic techniques and quantum mechanical calculations, it is clear that spin-orbit coupling contributes significantly to berkeliums multiconfigurational ground state.

A cost concern about free provision is that some recipients may not use the product, wasting resources (overinclusion). Yet, charging a price to screen out nonusers may screen out poor people who need and would use the product (overexclusion). We report on a randomized controlled trial of a screening mechanism that combines the free provision of chlorine solution for water treatment with a small nonmonetary cost (household vouchers that need to be redeemed monthly in order). Relative to a nonvoucher free distribution program, this mechanism reduces the quantity of chlorine procured by 60 percentage points, but reduces the share of households whose stored water tests positive for chlorine residual by only one percentage point, substantially improving the trade-off between overinclusion and overexclusion.

Here we report an atomic structure of a catalytic step I spliceosome (known as the C complex) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as determined by cryoelectron microscopy at an average resolution of 3.4 angstroms. In the structure, the 2-OH of the invariant adenine nucleotide in the branch point sequence (BPS) is covalently joined to the phosphate at the 5 end of the 5 splice site (5SS), forming an intron lariat. The freed 5 exon remains anchored to loop I of U5 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), and the 5SS and BPS of the intron form duplexes with conserved U6 and U2 snRNA sequences, respectively. Specific placement of these RNA elements at the catalytic cavity of Prp8 is stabilized by 15 protein components, including Snu114 and the splicing factors Cwc21, Cwc22, Cwc25, and Yju2. These features, representing the conformation of the spliceosome after the first-step reaction, predict structural changes that are needed for the execution of the second-step transesterification reaction.

Here, we report an atomic structure of an activated spliceosome (known as the Bact complex) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, determined by cryoelectron microscopy at an average resolution of 3.52 angstroms. The final refined model contains U2 and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs), U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), nineteen complex (NTC), NTC-related (NTR) protein, and a 71-nucleotide pre-mRNA molecule, which amount to 13,505 amino acids from 38 proteins and a combined molecular mass of about 1.6 megadaltons. The 5 exon is anchored by loop I of U5 snRNA, whereas the 5 splice site (5SS) and the branch-point sequence (BPS) of the intron are specifically recognized by U6 and U2 snRNA, respectively. Except for coordination of the catalytic metal ions, the RNA elements at the catalytic cavity of Prp8 are mostly primed for catalysis. The catalytic latency is maintained by the SF3b complex, which encircles the BPS, and the splicing factors Cwc24 and Prp11, which shield the 5 exon5SS junction. This structure, together with those determined earlier, outlines a molecular framework for the pre-mRNA splicing reaction.

Chemical derivatization of these diterpenoids has demonstrated that certain peripheral structural modifications can alter binding affinity and selectivity among ryanodine receptor isoforms. Here, we report a short chemical synthesis of (+)-ryanodol that proceeds in only 15 steps from the commercially available terpene (S)-pulegone. The efficiency of the synthesis derives from the use of a Pauson-Khand reaction to rapidly build the carbon framework and a SeO2-mediated oxidation to install three oxygen atoms in a single step. This work highlights how strategic CO bond constructions can streamline the synthesis of polyhydroxylated terpenes by minimizing protecting group and redox adjustments.

In this regime, the relative roles of inter- and intraband light-driven electronic transitions remain uncertain. We applied attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to investigate the interaction between polycrystalline diamond and a few-femtosecond infrared pulse with intensity below the critical intensity of optical breakdown. Ab initio time-dependent density functional theory calculations, in tandem with a two-band parabolic model, accounted for the experimental results in the framework of the dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect and identified infrared induction of intraband currents as the main physical mechanism responsible for the observations.

Delineation of the source locations and energy partition of the seismic wave components are key to understanding the excitation mechanisms. Using a seismic array in Japan, we observed both P and S wave microseisms excited by a severe distant storm in the Atlantic Ocean. Although nonlinear forcing of an ocean swell with a one-dimensional Earth model can explain P waves and vertically polarized S waves (SV waves), it cannot explain horizontally polarized S waves (SH waves). The precise source locations may provide a new catalog for exploring Earths interior.

Here we present a straightforward approach for addressing complexity in dynamic interconnected systems. We show that complexity, in the form of multiple interacting components, can actually be an asset for studying natural systems from temporal data. The central idea is that multidimensional time series enable system dynamics to be reconstructed from multiple viewpoints, and these viewpoints can be combined into a single model. We show how our approach, multiview embedding (MVE), can improve forecasts for simulated ecosystems and a mesocosm experiment. By leveraging complexity, MVE is particularly effective for overcoming the limitations of short and noisy time series and should be highly relevant for many areas of science.

However, it is difficult to capture rare dynamic processes, such as adult neurogenesis, because isolation of rare neurons from adult tissue is challenging and markers for each phase are limited. Here, we develop Div-Seq, which combines scalable single-nucleus RNA-Seq (sNuc-Seq) with pulse labeling of proliferating cells by 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) to profile individual dividing cells. sNuc-Seq and Div-Seq can sensitively identify closely related hippocampal cell types and track transcriptional dynamics of newborn neurons within the adult hippocampal neurogenic niche, respectively. We also apply Div-Seq to identify and profile rare newborn neurons in the adult spinal cord, a noncanonical neurogenic region. sNuc-Seq and Div-Seq open the way for unbiased analysis of diverse complex tissues.

Hypoxia promotes the resistance of tumor cells to specific therapies. We therefore explored a possible link between hypoxia and Akt activity. We found that Akt was prolyl-hydroxylated by the oxygen-dependent hydroxylase EglN1. The von HippelLindau protein (pVHL) bound directly to hydroxylated Akt and inhibited Akt activity. In cells lacking oxygen or functional pVHL, Akt was activated to promote cell survival and tumorigenesis. We also identified cancer-associated Akt mutations that impair Akt hydroxylation and subsequent recognition by pVHL, thus leading to Akt hyperactivation. Our results show that microenvironmental changes, such as hypoxia, can affect tumor behaviors by altering Akt activation, which has a critical role in tumor growth and therapeutic resistance.

We identified host molecules that are essential for murine NoV (MNoV)induced cell death, including CD300lf as a proteinaceous receptor. We found that CD300lf is essential for MNoV binding and replication in cell lines and primary cells. Additionally, Cd300lf/ mice are resistant to MNoV infection. Expression of CD300lf in human cells breaks the species barrier that would otherwise restrict MNoV replication. The crystal structure of the CD300lf ectodomain reveals a potential ligand-binding cleft composed of residues that are critical for MNoV infection. Therefore, the presence of a proteinaceous receptor is the primary determinant of MNoV species tropism, whereas other components of cellular machinery required for NoV replication are conserved between humans and mice.

Once outside the Airlock, the crew performed the following scheduled tasks: Retract, cover, and cinch down the TTCR using hook straps Replace a failed External Television Camera Group (ETVCG) light at the Camera Port 9 (CP9) location Install a High Definition Camera in the CP9 location Re-torque the Alpha Joint Interface Structure (AJIS) Struts on the Port 4 (P4) truss Perform an inspection Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ) Port 6 (P6) Pump Flow and Control System (PFCS) Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) Tie-back The crew was ahead on the timeline, so they were also able to install an additional High Definition Camera at the CP8 location, and perform the Port Crew and Equipment Translation Aid (CETA) Cart Brake Handle Tie-Down task. While Williams and Rubin were outside, FE-5 Onishi operated the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) and assisted with the tasks. The EVA duration was 6 hours, 48 minutes. Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations for EVA: Today Robotics Ground Controllers powered up the MSS to support the TTCR EVA. Once the EVA crew completed the TTCR retract, FE-5 maneuvered the SSRMS into position to install an Articulating Portable Foot Restraint (APFR) on the SSRMS Latching End Effector (LEE). CDR ingressed the APFR, and the SSRMS was maneuvered to allow CDR to change the light of the CP9 (P1 Lower Outboard (LOOB)) camera then again to position CDR to install an External High Definition Camera (EHDC) on the CP9 camera. Once the CP9 tasks had been completed, the SSRMS was maneuvered to position CDR to install an EHDC on the CP8 (P1 Upper Outboard (UPOB)) camera. Once this had been completed, the SSRMS was moved to a park position. MSS performance today was nominal. Todays Planned Activities All activities were completed unless otherwise noted.

This afternoon the crew performed a conference with EVA ground specialist to discuss any final question about tomorrows TTCR EVA. The crew also prepared the Equipment Lock, EMUs and ancillary hardware to support EVA prep activities. Crew egress of the Airlock is scheduled for 7:10 am CDT. Multi-Omics sample collections: Flight Engineer-5 collected samples for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Multi-Omics experiment. Samples were then placed into the Minus Eighty Degree Celsius Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI). The Multi-omics analysis of human microbial-metabolic cross-talk in the space ecosystem (Multi-Omics) investigation evaluates the impacts of space environment and prebiotics on astronauts immune function, by combining the data obtained from the measurements of changes in the gut microbiological composition, metabolites profiles, and the immune system. Biomarkers for immune dysfunction during the crewmembers time on the ISS could be useful for the health management of astronauts. Habitability walkthrough: The Commander performed his sixth and final Habitability walkthrough video. Williams has been requested to focus on the windows available to the crew on the ISS, and their impact on habitability and productivity. The Habitability investigation results will be used to assess the relationship between crew members and their environment in order to better prepare for future long-duration spaceflights. Observations recorded during 6 month and 1 year missions can help spacecraft designers determine how much habitable volume is required, and whether a missions duration impacts how much space crew members need. Fine Motor Skills (FMS): Flight Engineer-5 completed his 9th of 20 sessions of FMS. Performing a series of interactive tasks on a touchscreen tablet were completed for the Fine Motor Skills investigation. This investigation is critical during long-duration space missions, particularly those skills needed to interact with technologies required in next-generation space vehicles, spacesuits, and habitats. The crewmembers fine motor skills are also necessary for performing tasks in transit or on a planetary surface, such as information access, just-in-time training, subsystem maintenance, and medical treatment. Circadian Rhythms: After 36 hours of wear-time, Flight Engineer-5 doffed the Double Sensors and Thermolab Control Unit and stowed the equipment. The objective of the experiment is to get a better understanding of any alterations in circadian rhythms in humans during long-term space flights. Such knowledge will not only provide important insights into the adaptations of the human autonomic nervous system in space over time, but also has significant practical implications by helping to improve physical exercise, rest- and work shifts as well as fostering adequate workplace illumination in the sense of occupational healthcare in future space missions.

The goal of the Cardio Ox investigation is to determine whether biological markers of oxidative and inflammatory stress are elevated during and after space flight and whether this results in an increased, long-term risk of atherosclerosis risk in astronauts. Twelve crewmembers provide blood and urine samples to assess biomarkers before launch, 15 and 60 days after launch, 15 days before returning to Earth, and within days after landing. Ultrasound scans of the carotid and brachial arteries are obtained at the same time points, as well as through 5 years after landing, as an indicator of cardiovascular health. Dose Tracker: The crew completed entries for medication tracking on an iPad today. This investigation documents the medication usage of crewmembers before and during their missions by capturing data regarding medication use during spaceflight, including side effect qualities, frequencies and severities. The data is expected to either support or counter anecdotal evidence of medication ineffectiveness during flight and unusual side effects experienced during flight. It is also expected that specific, near-real-time questioning about symptom relief and side effects will provide the data required to establish whether spaceflight-associated alterations in pharmacokinetics (PK) or pharmacodynamics (PD) is occurring during missions. Fine Motor Skills: A series of interactive tasks were completed for the Fine Motor Skills investigation. This investigation is critical during long-duration space missions, particularly those skills needed to interact with technologies required in next-generation space vehicles, spacesuits, and habitats. The crewmembers fine motor skills are also necessary for performing tasks in transit or on a planetary surface, such as information access, just-in-time training, subsystem maintenance, and medical treatment. Habitability Human Factors Directed Observations: The crew recorded and submitted a walk-through video documenting observations of life onboard ISS, providing insight related to human factors and habitability. The Habitability investigation collects observations about the relationship between crew members and their environment on the ISS. Observations can help spacecraft designers understand how much habitable volume is required, and whether a missions duration impacts how much space crew members need. Trailing Thermal Control Radiator (TTCR) Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparations: The EV crew continued the EVA tool configuration in preparation for the TTCR EVA on Thursday. The IV crew accessed the Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics (DOUG) software and completed additional robotics reviews of Space Station Remote Manipulator System support plan for the EVA. External Television Camera Group (ETVCG) Troubleshooting: The crew performed a procedure to verify that the heaters on the spare ETVCG Light are functional. They utilized the two jumpers that were built from pin kit materials and tested the ETVCG light and heaters. After the troubleshooting, the crew confirmed a functional camera light and heater circuit on the ETVCG. This light will be used to replace the degraded light at the P1 Lower Outboard location during Thursdays TTCR EVA. Todays Planned Activities All activities completed unless otherwise noted.

The Biomolecule Sequencer investigation seeks to demonstrate for the first time that DNA sequencing is feasible in an orbiting spacecraft. A space-based DNA sequencer could identify microbes, diagnose diseases and understand crew member health, and potentially help detect DNA-based life elsewhere in the solar system. Marrow Blood, Breath, and Ambient Air Sample Collection: Over the weekend the crew set up the Marrow air sample collection hardware in the crew quarters and today upon waking the crew took breath and ambient air samples to measure carbon monoxide concentration for the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) Marrow experiment. Marrow investigates the effect of microgravity on human bone marrow. It is believed that microgravity, like long-duration bed rest on Earth, has a negative effect on bone marrow and the blood cells that are produced in the marrow. The extent of this effect and its recovery are of interest to space research and healthcare providers on Earth. Human Research Program (HRP) Generic Urine and Frozen Blood Collection Double Spin: The crew continued HRP operations that began over the weekend by collecting saliva and urine samples for 24-hours and processing a set of blood samples for double spin operations using the Refrigerated Centrifuge. The samples were stowed in the Minus Eighty-degree Freezer for ISS MELFI. Mouse Epigenetics Closeout and Reconfiguration Operations: The crew performed Mouse Epigenetics closeout and reconfiguration activities to clean up and disassemble the Glove Box before removing the Mouse Habitat Cage Unit from the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF). The crew also changed the CBEF video output cable configuration from multiple channel cable to single channel cable and disconnect the CBEF Multiple Video Cable between CBEF and Image Processing Unit (IPU) as well as the CBEF and Video compression and Recording Unit 2 (VRU2) on Multi-purpose Small PayloadRack2 (MSPR2). Thermolab Instrumentation for Circadian Rhythms: The crew began the first of a three-day European Space Agency (ESA) Circadian Rhythms experiment by performing instrumentation with the Thermolab Double sensors, mounting the Thermolab Unit in the belt, connecting and powering on the Thermolab Unit before beginning a 36 hour continuous measurement. After the measurement was completed, the data was transferred and hardware stowed. The objective of the experiment is to get a better understanding of alterations in circadian rhythms in humans during long-term space flights. Such knowledge will not only provide important insights into the adaptations of the human autonomic nervous system in space over time, but also has significant practical implications by helping to improve physical exercise, rest and work shifts as well as fostering adequate workplace illumination in the sense of occupational healthcare in future space missions. Multi-Omics Operations: Today the crew supported the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Multi-Omics investigation by collecting body samples and inserting them into a Box Module in the Minus Eighty-degree Freezer for ISS (MELFI). The investigation evaluates the impacts of space environment and prebiotics on astronauts immune function by combining the data obtained from the measurements of changes in the microbiological composition, metabolites profiles, and the immune system. Habitability Human Factors Directed Observations: The crew will recorded and submited a walk-through video documenting observations of life onboard ISS, providing insight related to human factors and habitability. The Habitability investigation collects observations about the relationship between crew members and their environment on the ISS. Observations can help spacecraft designers understand how much habitable volume is required and whether a missions duration impacts how much space crew members need. Trailing Thermal Control Radiator (TTCR) Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparations: The Extravehicular (EV) crew conducted a review of procedures that cover the suit donning plan, pre-breathe protocol, Equipment Lock activities, egress and detailed EVA timeline. Following the review they participated in a conference with ground teams. The Intravehicular (IV) crew accessed the Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics (DOUG) software and completed a robotics review of Space Station Remote Manipulator System support plan for US EVA #37 this Thursday. External Television Camera Group (ETVCG) Troubleshooting Test Lead Build: The crew performed part 1 of a procedure to verify the heaters on the spare ETVCG Light are functional. They built two jumpers from pin kit materials for use in tomorrow&#8217;s task. Remote Power Control Module (RPCM) Remove &#38; Replace (R&#38;R): Over the weekend, Robotics Ground Controllers unstowed the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) from Mobile Base System (MBS) Power Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF)2. At the end of re-rigidizing the SPDM Latching End Effector (LEE) for SPDM unstow, the SPDM safed, which has been observed previously. Controllers performed the necessary recovery steps and released the SPDM LEE from MBS PDGF2. Once the SPDM had been unstowed, controllers maneuvered the SSRMS and SPDM to position SPDM Arm2 to use Robot Micro Conical Tool #2 (RMCT2) to demate and remove RPCM P12B_A from its slot which was previously attempted on June 14, 2016 without success. Today, after numerous pull and wiggle attempts, the RPCM came out of its slot. Both the RPCM and its slot were inspected and nothing was seen that would preclude pressing with stowing the RPCM in a spare slot and installing another RPCM in Slot P12B_A. This RPCM was then stowed in Spare Slot P13A_H. Controllers commanded the SPDM Arm 2 On-Orbit Replaceable Unit (ORU) Tool Change-out Mechanism (OTCM) handling the RMCT2 to release the Failed RPCM (removed from P12B_A slot) in the P13A_H slot. They then maneuvered the SSRMS and SPDM to position SPDM Arm2 to align RMCT2 with the spare RPCM located in P11A_D to demate and remove it from its slot. This RPCM was then moved to the P12B_A slot. It was successfully inserted and bolted to P12B_A worksite after being pushed with the maximum force allowed of 200 N. SPDM Arm 2 released the spare RPCM in P12B_A and ground teams confirmed it was functioning nominally. 46 Soyuz Survey: Following the RPCM R&#38;R, [&#8230;]</p></details></div><div><details><summary class='inner'><a href='https://blogs.nasa.gov/stationreport/2016/08/26/iss-daily-summary-report-08262016/' target='_blank'>ISS Daily Summary Report  08/26/2016</a></summary><p>SpaceX (SpX)-9 Release: Following the unberth of Dragon yesterday afternoon, the crew used the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) to release Dragon at 5:11 AM Central Time for its return to Earth. The Dragon capsule executed a de-orbit burn shortly after 10 AM Central Time, and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean approximately 45 minutes later. SpaceX-9 returned cargo and science samples which were processed onboard the ISS for analysis on the ground. Biological Rhythms 48 Holter and Actiwatch Removal and Data Save: Following two consecutive days of Biological Rhythms recording sessions, the crew removed the Digital Walk Holter Electrocardiogram (ECG) and the Actiwatch Spectrum and saved the collected data to the medical laptop. This concluded the Biological Rhythms experiment where two separate 24-hour Actiwatch measurements were performed to study the effects of long-term microgravity exposure on heart functions by analyzing an astronauts electrocardiogram for 48 hours. Biomolecule Sequencer Hardware Setup and Sample Initialization: The crew retrieved the Flow Cell and the Media Syringe Tube from Minus Eighty-degree Freezer for ISS (MELFI) before using the syringe to inject the sample into the Biomolecule Sequencer, which began the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing process. The Biomolecule Sequencer investigation seeks to demonstrate for the first time that DNA sequencing is feasible in an orbiting spacecraft. A space-based DNA sequencer could identify microbes, diagnose diseases and understand crew member health, and potentially help detect DNA-based life elsewhere in the solar system. Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) Manifold Bottle Replacement: The crew R&#38;Rd a CIR manifold bottle on one of the four CIR Manifolds in support of upcoming Flex 2 payload investigation activities. Fine Motor Skills: A series of interactive tasks on a touchscreen tablet were completed for the Fine Motor Skills investigation. This investigation is critical during long-duration space missions, particularly those skills needed to interact with technologies required in next-generation space vehicles, spacesuits, and habitats. The crewmembers fine motor skills are also necessary for performing tasks in transit or on a planetary surface, such as information access, just-in-time training, subsystem maintenance, and medical treatment. Space Headaches: The crew completed the European Space Agency (ESA) Space Headaches questionnaire which provides information that may help in the development of methods to alleviate associated symptoms and improvement in the well-being and performance of crew members in space. LS-1 Server Issues: Following the recent issues with the LS-1 server, the crew performed a laptop shell swap (motherboard, processor, memory) and retained only the hard drives. The LS-1 came back online without any issues. LAB RWS Monitor Display Issue: Prior to Dragon release, the SSRMS Lab Robotic Work Station (RWS) Monitor 1 was observed to be very dim, with the image shifted, and it seemed to be a negative image. The crew tried the brightness adjustment and checked the cables with no success. The video feed was moved from the degraded display Monitor 1 to a Monitor 3 which was operating nominally. The release and departure monitoring were completed nominally and on time. The LAB RWS Monitor 1 was later recovered by power cycling the Control Electronic Unit (CEU). The root cause is still under investigation. Todays Planned Activities All activities were completed unless otherwise noted. MORZE.

Space Automated Bioproduct Lab (SABL) CO2 Controller Removal: SABL-1s CO2 Incubator Controller was removed for return on SpaceX-9. SPHERES Blue Satellite: The CO2 tank in the SPHERES blue satellite was removed, vented, and packed. Meteor Hard Drive Retrieval: The Meteor Laptop hard drive was retrieved. Mouse Epigenetics Habitat Cage Unit Maintenance: The Mouse Cage Units containing the mice were transferred from the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF) to the glove box to conduct food cartridge exchanges and cleaning activities. The crew also performed troubleshooting activities on the Transportation Cage Units (TCU) by performing individual cover replacements, cage block replacements, and TCU exchanges to prepare for return on SpX-9. The Mouse Cage Units were then returned to CBEF. The Mouse Epigenetics investigation studies altered gene expression patterns in the organs of male mice that spend one month in space, and also examines changes in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of their offspring. Results from the investigation identify genetic alterations that happen after exposure to the microgravity environment of space. Biomolecule Sequencer Surface Pro 3 Hardware Checkout: The crew set up and connected Surface Pro 3 tablets to the wireless network before completing checkout activities to support upcoming Biomolecule Sequencer operations later this week. The Biomolecule Sequencer investigation seeks to demonstrate for the first time that DNA sequencing is feasible in an orbiting spacecraft. A space-based DNA sequencer could identify microbes, diagnose diseases and understand crew member health and potentially help detect DNA-based life elsewhere in the solar system. Fine Motor Skills: A series of interactive tasks on a touchscreen tablet was completed for the Fine Motor Skills investigation. This investigation is critical during long-duration space missions, particularly those skills needed to interact with technologies required in next-generation space vehicles, spacesuits, and habitats. The crewmembers fine motor skills are also necessary for performing tasks in transit or on a planetary surface, such as information access, just-in-time training, subsystem maintenance, and medical treatment. Habitability Human Factors Directed Observations: The crew recorded and submitted a walk-through video documenting observations of life onboard ISS, providing insight related to human factors and habitability. The Habitability investigation collects observations about the relationship between crew members and their environment on the ISS. Observations can help spacecraft designers understand how much habitable volume is required, and whether a missions duration impacts how much space crew members need. Dose Tracker: The crew completed entries for medication tracking on an iPad today. This investigation documents the medication usage of crewmembers before and during their missions by capturing data regarding medication use during spaceflight, including side effect qualities, frequencies and severities. The data is expected to either support or counter anecdotal evidence of medication ineffectiveness during flight and unusual side effects experienced during flight. It is also expected that specific, near-real-time questioning about symptom relief and side effects will provide the data required to establish whether spaceflight-associated alterations in pharmacokinetics (PK) or pharmacodynamics (PD) is occurring during missions. Columbus Payload Power Switching Box (PPSB) &#8211; SDX Switch 1 Reconfiguration: The crew reconfigured the SDX 1 switch on the PPSB1 for RapidScat in Columbus in preparation for tomorrows 63P reboost. Columbus Power Distribution Unit 1 (PDU-1) Troubleshooting: On Monday, ground teams were unable to repower the COLs PDU-1 Outlet 3 which provides operational power to RapidScat and Solar Monitoring Observatory (SOLAR) payloads. Today, ground teams successfully repowered SOLAR from Outlet 3 by turning OFF the Columbus Payload Power Switching Box (PPSB) &#8211; SDX switch 1 to isolate RapidScat from the power feed. RapidScat has active heater power and can remain deactivated with no impact to hardware. Ground teams continue to investigate the anomaly. Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations: Last night Robotics Ground Controllers stowed the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) on Mobile Base System (MBS) Power Data Grapple Fixture #2 (PDGF2).

C&#38;C 2 MDM was transitioned to primary with C&#38;C 3 MDM in backup and C&#38;C 1 MDM in standby. The transition supports the desired configuration for OA-5, ensuring that the primary Guidance, Navigation and Control (GN&#38;C) MDM and the primary C&#38;C MDM are not on the same power channels. Columbus Power Distribution Unit 1 (PDU-1) Repower: Last Friday the Columbus Module experienced a power anomaly with Power Distribution Unit 1 (PDU-1), and a subset of the loads on PDU-1 lost power. Systems were automatically safed. All downstream loads have since been repowered with the exception of RapidScat. During an attempt to reactivate RapidScat, outlet 3 on PDU-1 tripped. The only two items downstream of this outlet are RapidScat and Solar Monitoring Observatory (SOLAR), which was deactivated at the time of the trip. RapidScat has active heater power and is able to stay deactivated indefinitely without hardware impact. Ground teams are investigating the cause of the outlet 3 trip. Payload Activities Completed Over the Weekend: Mouse Epigenetics Habitat Cage Unit Maintenance: The crew completed standard maintenance activities by exchanging the food cartridges and refilling the water of Mouse Habitat Cage Units which is located in the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF). Heart Cells Media Change Operations: The crew changed the media in the Multiwell BioCell for Heart Cells and repaired one of the Multiwell BioCells within the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) work volume to provide nutrients to the Heart Cells. Biological Rhythms 48 Hours Actiwatch Preparation: In preparation for upcoming Biological Rhythms activities this week, the crew configured of the Actiwatch using the Actiware Software and Medical Laptop. NanoRack Module 9: Session 4 of 5 for the NanoRack Module 9 experiment was completed when the crew activated, deactivated, and shook the mixture tubes to facilitate the experiment. Fine Motor Skills: A series of interactive tasks on a touchscreen tablet were completed for the Fine Motor Skills investigation. Space Headaches: The crew completed the European Space Agency (ESA) Space Headaches questionnaire. Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) Hard Drive Change: The crew swapped the AMS hard drives in the UltraBay Adapter in the AMS laptop, which is completed every six months.</p></details></div><div><details><summary class='inner'><a href='https://blogs.nasa.gov/stationreport/2016/08/19/iss-daily-summary-report-08192016/' target='_blank'>ISS Daily Summary Report  08/19/2016</a></summary><p>U.S. Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #36: Williams (EV-1) and Rubins (EV-2) completed the following activities to install the International Docking Adapter (IDA)2 with Intravehicular (IV) support from FE-5: Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA)-2 setup Preliminary IDA installation Initial IDA cable installation PMA-2 hemi reflector cover installation Final IDA cable installation IDA outfitting IDA cleanup IDA3 cable routing Multiplexer/Demultiplexer (MDM) ethernet cable connection MDM ethernet cable routing Station/Shuttle Power Transfer System (SSPTS) cap removal Tomorrow the crew will perform post-EVA cleanup activities and a post-EVA debrief with ground teams.
