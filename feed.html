luminosities (L$_{X,Gas}$) for a sample of 29 massive early-type galaxies from
the SLUGGS survey to probe L$_{X,Gas}$--mass scaling relations. In particular,
we investigate scalings with stellar mass, dynamical mass within 5 effective
radii (R$_e$) and total virial mass. We also compare these relations with
predictions from $\Lambda$CDM simulations. We find a strong linear relationship
between L$_{X,Gas}$ and galaxy dynamical mass within 5 R$_e$, which is
consistent with the recent cosmological simulations of Choi et al. that
incorporate mechanical heating from AGN. We conclude that the gas surrounding
massive early-type galaxies was shock heated as it fell into collapsing dark
matter halos so that L$_{X,Gas}$ is primarily driven by the depth of a galaxy's
potential well. Heating by an AGN plays an important secondary role in
determining L$_{X,Gas}$.

an unprecedented number of redshifts, currently dominate large-scale structure
studies. However, physical constraints limit these surveys from successfully
collecting redshifts from galaxies too close to each other on the focal plane.
This ultimately leads to significant systematic effects on galaxy clustering
measurements. Using simulated mock catalogs, we demonstrate that fiber
collisions have a significant impact on the power spectrum, $P(k)$, monopole
and quadrupole that exceeds sample variance at scales smaller than
$k\sim0.1~h/Mpc$.
</p>
<p>We present two methods to account for fiber collisions in the power spectrum.
The first, statistically reconstructs the clustering of fiber collided galaxy
pairs by modeling the distribution of the line-of-sight displacements between
them. It also properly accounts for fiber collisions in the shot-noise
correction term of the $P(k)$ estimator. Using this method, we recover the true
$P(k)$ monopole of the mock catalogs with residuals of $&lt;0.5\%$ at
$k=0.3~h/Mpc$ and $&lt;4\%$ at $k=0.83~h/Mpc$ -- a significant improvement over
existing correction methods. The quadrupole, however, does not improve
significantly.
</p>
<p>The second method models the effect of fiber collisions on the power spectrum
as a convolution with a configuration space top-hat function that depends on
the physical scale of fiber collisions. It directly computes theoretical
predictions of the fiber-collided $P(k)$ multipoles and reduces the influence
of smaller scales to a set of nuisance parameters. Using this method, we
reliably model the effect of fiber collisions on the monopole and quadrupole
down to the scale limits of theoretical predictions. The methods we present in
this paper will allow us to robustly analyze galaxy power spectrum multipole
measurements to much smaller scales than previously possible.

galactic nuclei are some of the most promising gravitational wave (GWs) sources
for next generation GW-detectors. The rates of such extreme mass ratio
inspirals (EMRIs) depend on the dynamics and distribution of compact objects
around the MBH. Here we study the impact of mass-segregation processes on EMRI
rates. In particular, we provide the expected mass function of EMRIs, given an
initial mass function of stellar BHs (SBHs), and relate it to the
mass-dependent detection rate of EMRIs. We then consider the role of star
formation on the distribution of compact objects and its implication on EMRI
rates. We find that the existence of a wide spectrum of SBH masses lead to the
overall increase of EMRI rates, and to high rates of the EMRIs from the
most-massive SBHs. However, it also leads to a relative quenching of EMRI rates
from lower-mass SBHs, and together produces a steep dependence of the EMRI mass
function on the highest-mass SBHs. Star-formation history plays a relatively
small role in determining the EMRI rates of SBHs, since most of them migrate
close to the MBH through mass-segregation rather than forming in-situ. However,
the EMRI rate of neutron stars can be significantly increased when they form
in-situ close to the MBH, as they can inspiral before relaxation processes
significantly segregates them outwards. A reverse but weaker effect of
decreasing the EMRI rates from neutron stars and white dwarfs occurs when
star-formation proceeds far from the MBH.

challenge to low-amplitude variability detection. In search for a
general-purpose variability detection technique able to recover a broad range
of variability types including currently unknown ones, we test 18 statistical
characteristics quantifying scatter and/or correlation between brightness
measurements. We compare their performance in identifying variable objects in
seven time-series datasets obtained with telescopes ranging in size from a
telephoto lens to 1m-class and probing variability on timescales from minutes
to decades. The test datasets together include lightcurves of 127539 objects,
among them 1251 variable stars of various types and represent a range of
observing conditions often found in ground-based variability surveys. The real
data are complemented by simulations. We propose a combination of two indices
that together recover a broad range of variability types from photometric data
characterized by a wide variety of sampling patterns, photometric accuracies,
and percentages of outlier measurements. The first index is the interquartile
range (IQR) of magnitude measurements, sensitive to variability irrespective of
a timescale and resistant to outliers. It can be complemented by the ratio of
the lightcurve variance to the mean square successive difference, 1/h, which is
efficient in detecting variability on timescales longer than the typical time
interval between observations. Variable objects have larger 1/h and/or IQR
values than non-variable objects of similar brightness. Another approach to
variability detection is to combine many variability indices using principal
component analysis. We present 124 previously unknown variable stars found in
the test data.

The accuracy of the KB approximation.</a></summary><p>We investigate the accuracy of an approximate radiative transfer technique
that was first proposed by Kylafis &amp; Bahcall (hereafter the KB approximation)
and has been popular in modelling dusty late-type galaxies. We compare
realistic galaxy models calculated with the KB approximation with those of a
three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code SKIRT. The SKIRT code
fully takes into account of the contribution of multiple scattering whereas the
KB approximation calculates only single scattered intensity and multiple
scattering components are approximated. We find that the KB approximation gives
fairly accurate results if optically thin, face-on galaxies are considered.
However, for highly inclined ($i \gtrsim 85^{\circ}$) and/or optically thick
(central face-on optical depth $\gtrsim1$) galaxy models, the approximation can
give rise to substantial errors, sometimes, up to $\gtrsim 40\%$. Moreover, it
is also found that the KB approximation is not always physical, sometimes
producing infinite intensities at lines of sight with high optical depth in
edge-on galaxy models. There is no "simple recipe" to correct the errors of the
KB approximation that is universally applicable to any galaxy models.
Therefore, it is recommended that the full radiative transfer calculation be
used, even though it's slower than the KB approximation.

inside larger dark matter haloes differ sharply among alternative dark matter
models. Too small to host galaxies themselves, these subhaloes may still be
detected via gravitational lensing, or via perturbations of the Milky Way's
globular cluster streams and its stellar disk. Here we use the Apostle
cosmological simulations to predict the abundance and the spatial and velocity
distributions of subhaloes in the range 10^6.5-10^8.5 solar masses inside
haloes of mass ~ 10^12 solar masses in LCDM. Although these subhaloes are
themselves devoid of baryons, we find that baryonic effects are important.
Compared to corresponding dark matter only simulations, the loss of baryons
from subhaloes and stronger tidal disruption due to the presence of baryons
near the centre of the main halo, reduce the number of subhaloes by ~ 1/4 to
1/2, independently of subhalo mass, but increasingly towards the host halo
centre. We also find that subhaloes have non-Maxwellian orbital velocity
distributions, with centrally rising velocity anisotropy and positive velocity
bias which reduces the number of low-velocity subhaloes, particularly near the
halo centre. We parameterise the predicted population of subhaloes in terms of
mass, galactocentric distance, and velocities. We discuss implications of our
results for the prospects of detecting dark matter substructures and for
possible inferences about the nature of dark matter.

high-redshift ($z \simeq 6$) galaxies with the aim of characterizing their
internal properties and interstellar medium. Among other features, we adopt a
star formation model based on a physically-sound molecular hydrogen
prescription, and introduce a novel scheme for supernova feedback, stellar
winds and dust-mediated radiation pressure. In the zoom-in simulation the
target halo hosts "Dahlia", a galaxy with a stellar mass $M_*=1.6\times
10^{10}$M$_\odot$, representative of a typical $z\sim 6$ Lyman Break Galaxy.
Dahlia has a total H2 mass of $10^{8.5}$M$_\odot$, that is mainly concentrated
in a disk-like structure of effective radius $\simeq 0.6$ kpc and scale height
$\simeq 200$ pc. Frequent mergers drive fresh gas towards the center of the
disk, sustaining a star formation rate per unit area of $\simeq 15 $M$_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$. The disk is composed by dense ($n \gtrsim 25$ cm$^{-3}$),
metal-rich ($Z \simeq 0.5 $ Z$_\odot$) gas, that is pressure-supported by
radiation. We compute the $158\mu$m [CII] emission arising from {Dahlia}, and
find that $\simeq 95\%$ of the total [CII] luminosity
($L_{[CII]}\simeq10^{7.5}$ L$_\odot$) arises from the H2 disk. Although $30\%$
of the CII mass is transported out of the disk by outflows, such gas negligibly
contributes to [CII] emission, due to its low density ($n \lesssim 10$
cm$^{-3}$) and metallicity ($Z\lesssim 10^{-1}$Z$_\odot$). Dahlia is
under-luminous with respect to the local [CII]-SFR relation; however, its
luminosity is consistent with upper limits derived for most $z\sim6$ galaxies.

and main-sequence turn-off stars in the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6101, and
interpreted this feature as an indication that this cluster is not
mass-segregated. Using direct N-body simulations, we find that a significant
amount of mass segregation is expected for a cluster with the mass, radius and
age of NGC 6101. Therefore, the absence of mass segregation cannot be explained
by the argument that the cluster is not yet dynamically evolved. By varying the
retention fraction of stellar-mass black holes, we show that segregation is not
observable in clusters with a high black hole retention fraction (&gt;50% after
supernova kicks and &gt;50% after dynamical evolution). Yet all model clusters
have the same amount of mass segregation in terms of the decline of the mean
mass of stars and remnants with distance to the centre. We also discuss how
kinematics can be used to further constrain the presence of a stellar-mass
black hole population and distinguish it from the effect of an
intermediate-mass black hole. Our results imply that the kick velocities of
black holes are lower than those of neutron stars. The large retention fraction
during its dynamical evolution can be explained if NGC 6101 formed with a large
initial radius in a Milky Way satellite.

linked to the orbital dynamics of the gas. Recent models suggest that star
formation within the dust ridge molecular clouds (from G0.253+0.016 to Sgr B2)
follows an evolutionary time sequence, triggered by tidal compression during
their preceding pericentre passage. Given that these clouds are the most likely
precursors to a generation of massive stars and extreme star clusters, this
scenario would have profound implications for constraining the time-evolution
of star formation. In this Letter, we search for the initial conditions of the
protocluster clouds, focusing on the kinematics of gas situated upstream from
pericentre. We observe a highly-regular corrugated velocity field in
$\{l,\,v_{\rm LSR}\}$ space, with amplitude and wavelength $A=3.7\,\pm\,0.1$
kms$^{-1}$ and $\lambda_{\rm vel, i}=22.5\,\pm\,0.1$ pc, respectively. The
extremes in velocity correlate with a series of massive
($\sim10^{4}$M$_{\odot}$) and compact ($R_{\rm eq}\sim2$ pc), quasi-regularly
spaced ($\sim8$ pc), molecular clouds. The corrugation wavelength and cloud
separation closely agree with the predicted Toomre ($\sim17$ pc) and Jeans
($\sim6$ pc) lengths, respectively. We conclude that gravitational
instabilities are driving the condensation of molecular clouds within the
Galactic Centre gas stream. Furthermore, we speculate these seeds are the
historical analogue of the dust-ridge molecular clouds, representing the
initial conditions of star and cluster formation in the CMZ.

require an efficient mechanism of energy dissipation and particle acceleration
in relativistic active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets. Particle acceleration in
relativistic magnetic reconnection is being actively studied by kinetic
numerical simulations. Relativistic reconnection produces hard power-law
electron energy distributions N(gamma) = N_0 gamma^(-p) exp(-gamma/gamma_max)
with index p -&gt; 1 and exponential cut-off Lorentz factor gamma_max ~ sigma in
the limit of magnetization sigma = B^2/(4 pi w) &gt;&gt; 1 (where w is the
relativistic enthalpy density). Reconnection in electron-proton plasma can
additionally boost gamma_max by the mass ratio m_p/m_e. Hence, in order to
accelerate particles to gamma_max ~ 10^6 in the case of BL Lacs, reconnection
should proceed in plasma of very high magnetization sigma_max &gt;~ 10^3. On the
other hand, moderate mean jet magnetization values are required for magnetic
bulk acceleration of relativistic jets, sigma_mean ~ Gamma_j &lt;~ 20 (where
Gamma_j is the jet bulk Lorentz factor). I propose that the systematic
dependence of gamma_max on blazar luminosity class -- the blazar sequence --
may result from a systematic trend in sigma_max due to homogeneous loading of
leptons by pair creation regulated by the energy density of high-energy
external radiation fields. At the same time, relativistic AGN jets should be
highly inhomogeneous due to filamentary loading of protons, which should
determine the value of sigma_mean roughly independently of the blazar class.

CO, Ly$\alpha$, and CII stand to provide powerful probes of high-redshift
astrophysics. However, these line emissions are highly non-Gaussian, and so the
typical power-spectrum methods used to study these maps will leave out a
significant amount of information. We propose a new statistic, the probability
distribution of voxel intensities, which can access this extra information.
Using a model of a CO intensity map at $z\sim3$ as an example, we demonstrate
that this voxel intensity distribution (VID) provides substantial constraining
power beyond what is obtainable from the power spectrum alone. We find that a
future survey similar to the planned COMAP Full experiment could constrain the
CO luminosity function to order $\sim10\%$. We also explore the effects of
contamination from continuum emission, interloper lines, and gravitational
lensing on our constraints and find that the VID statistic retains significant
constraining power even in pessimistic scenarios.

dwarfs (WDs) showcase the importance of modeling the long-term evolution of
small bodies in exosystems. WD debris discs are in particular thought to form
from very long-term (0.1-5.0 Gyr) instability between planets and asteroids.
However, the time-consuming nature of $N$-body integrators which accurately
simulate motion over Gyrs necessitates a judicious choice of initial
conditions. The analytical tools known as \textit{periodic orbits} can
circumvent the guesswork. Here, we begin a comprehensive analysis directly
linking periodic orbits with $N$-body integration outcomes with an extensive
exploration of the planar circular restricted three-body problem (CRTBP) with
an outer planet and inner asteroid near or inside of the $2$:$1$ mean motion
resonance. We run nearly 1000 focused simulations for the entire age of the
Universe (14 Gyr) with initial conditions mapped to the phase space locations
surrounding the unstable and stable periodic orbits for that commensurability.
In none of our simulations did the planar CRTBP architecture yield a
long-timescale ($\gtrsim 0.25$% of the age of the Universe) asteroid-star
collision. The pericentre distance of asteroids which survived beyond this
timescale ($\approx 35$ Myr) varied by at most about 60%. These results help
affirm that collisions occur too quickly to explain WD pollution in the planar
CRTBP $2$:$1$ regime, and highlight the need for further periodic orbit studies
with the eccentric and inclined TBP architectures and other significant orbital
period commensurabilities.

that low ionisation emission line regions (LIERs) in local galaxies result from
photoionisation by hot evolved stars, not active galactic nuclei. LIERs are
ubiquitous in both quiescent galaxies and in the central regions of galaxies
where star formation takes place at larger radii. We refer to these two classes
of galaxies as extended LIER (eLIER) and central LIER (cLIER) galaxies
respectively. cLIERs are late type galaxies located around the green valley, in
the transition region between the star formation main sequence and quiescent
galaxies. These galaxies display regular disc rotation in both stars and gas,
although featuring a higher central stellar velocity dispersion than star
forming galaxies of the same mass. cLIERs are consistent with being slowly
quenched inside-out; the transformation is associated with massive bulges,
pointing towards the importance of bulge growth via secular evolution. eLIERs
are morphologically early types and are indistinguishable from passive galaxies
devoid of line emission in terms of their stellar populations, morphology and
central stellar velocity dispersion. Ionised gas in eLIERs shows both disturbed
and disc-like kinematics. When a large-scale flow/rotation is observed in the
gas, it is often misaligned relative to the stellar component. These features
indicate that eLIERs are passive galaxies harbouring a residual cold gas
component, acquired mostly via external accretion. Importantly, quiescent
galaxies devoid of line emission reside in denser environments and have
significantly higher satellite fraction than eLIERs. Environmental effects thus
represent the likely cause for the existence of line-less galaxies on the red
sequence.

Our aims are (i) to investigate the physical causes behind the wide range of j
in galaxies at fixed mass at z=0 and (ii) examine whether simple, theoretical
models can explain the seemingly complex and non-linear nature of the evolution
of j in EAGLE. We find that j of the stars, jstars, and baryons, jbar, are
strongly correlated with stellar and baryon mass, respectively, and that the
dispersion of the relation is highly correlated with gas fraction, stellar
concentration, (u-r) colour, stellar age and the ratio of circular velocity to
velocity dispersion. We compare with available observations at z=0 and find
excellent agreement. Our findings suggest that in the case of all baryons and
stars, j follows the theoretical expectation of an isothermal collapsing halo
under conservation of j to within 50%. In rotation-supported galaxies, the
strong dependence of jstars and jbar on the neutral gas fraction is well
described by a model in which the disk angular momentum is just enough to
maintain marginally stable disks. We also identify average tracks for the
evolution of the spin parameter of the stars, lstars =j/M^2/3, (with j measured
within a half-stellar mass radius), depending on whether most of the stars
formed before or after turnaround (z~1.2 for our galaxies). In the absence of
mergers, galaxies older than 9Gyr (i.e. most stars formed before turnaround)
show little evolution in their lstars, while younger ones show a constant
lstars at z&gt;1.2, and then increase as lstars~a. Galaxy mergers reduce lstars by
a factor of 2-3. These tracks are driven by both the evolution of the total
jstars but also its radial distribution. Regardless of the aperture used to
measure j, two distinct channels leading to low jstars in galaxies at z=0 are
identified: (i) galaxy mergers, and (ii) early formation of most of the stars.

concentrated close to the GRB position and the nearby Wolf-Rayet region. The
high [OI] flux indicates high radiation field and gas density. The [CII]/CO
luminosity ratio of the GRB 980425 host is close to the highest values found
for local star-forming galaxies. Its CO-derived molecular gas mass is low given
its SFR and metallicity, but the [CII]-derived molecular gas mass is close to
the expected value. The [OI] and HI concentrations, and the high radiation
field and density are consistent with the hypothesis of a very recent (at most
a few tens of Myr ago) inflow of atomic gas triggering star formation. Dust has
not had time to build up (explaining high line-to-continuum ratios). Such a
recent enhancement of star-formation would indeed manifest itself in high
SFR_line/SFR_continuum ratios, because the line indicators are sensitive only
to recent (&lt;10 Myr) activity, whereas the continuum indicators measure the SFR
averaged over much longer periods (~100 Myr). Other GRB hosts exhibit a mean
SFR_line/SFR_continuum of 1.74+-0.32. This is consistent with a very recent
enhancement of star formation being common among GRB hosts, so galaxies which
have recently experienced inflow of gas may preferentially host stars exploding
as GRBs. Hence GRB hosts may be used to investigate recent gas accretion.

the continuum, solid state, and gas properties with mid-IR data obtained at the

decrease in overall brightness by ~ 14%. We find that this decrease in
luminosity occurs only at wavelengths &lt; 20 microns. In particular, the
continuum short ward of the silicate emission complex at 10 microns exhibits a
~ 12% (~ 3 sigma) drop in flux density, but no apparent change in slope; both
the Spitzer and SOFIA spectra are consistent with a 7200 K blackbody.
Additionally, the detection of water absorption is consistent with the Spitzer
spectrum. The silicate emission feature at 10 microns continues to be
consistent with unprocessed grains, unchanged over 12 years. We conclude that
either the accretion rate in FU Orionis has decreased by ~ 12-14% over this

remains in a superheated state outside of the innermost region.

Removing the contribution from this and the previously known unrelated sources,
the systemic velocity of Puppis A turns out to be limited between 8 and 12 km

conducting fluids using a Fourier-helical representation. We analytically study
both small- and large-scale dynamo properties, as well as the inverse cascade
of magnetic helicity, in the most general minimal subset of interacting
velocity and magnetic fields on a closed Fourier triad. We mainly focus on the
dependency of magnetic field growth as a function of the distribution of
kinetic and magnetic helicities among the three interacting wavenumbers. By
combining direct numerical simulations of the full magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
equations with the Fourier-helical decomposition we numerically confirm that in
the kinematic dynamo regime the system develops a large-scale magnetic helicity
with opposite sign compared to the small-scale kinetic helicity, a sort of
triad-by-triad $\alpha$-effect in Fourier space. Concerning the small-scale
perturbations, we predict theoretically and confirm numerically that the
largest instability is achived for the magnetic component with the same
helicity of the flow, in agreement with the Stretch-Twist-Fold mechanism.
Viceversa, in presence of a Lorentz feedback on the velocity, we find that the
inverse cascade of magnetic helicity is mostly local if magnetic and kinetic
helicities have opposite sign, while it is more non-local and more intense if
they have the same sign, as predicted by the analytical approach. Our
analytical and numerical results further demonstrate the potential of the
helical-Fourier decomposition to elucidate the entangled dynamics of magnetic

relies on coagulation from a mixture of sub-Mars sized planetary embryos and
(smaller) planetesimals that dynamically emerge from the evolving circum-solar
disc in the first few million years of our Solar System. Once the planets have,
for the most part, assembled after a giant impact phase, they continue to be
bombarded by a multitude of planetesimals left over from accretion. Here we
place limits on the mass and evolution of these planetesimals based on
constraints from the highly siderophile element (HSE) budget of the Moon.
Outcomes from a combination of N-body and Monte Carlo simulations of planet
formation lead us to four key conclusions about the nature of this early epoch.
First, matching the terrestrial to lunar HSE ratio requires either that the
late veneer on Earth consisted of a single lunar-size impactor striking the
Earth before 4.45 Ga, or that it originated from the impact that created the
Moon. An added complication is that analysis of lunar samples indicates the
Moon does not preserve convincing evidence for a late veneer like Earth.
Second, the expected chondritic veneer component on Mars is 0.06 weight
percent. Third, the flux of terrestrial impactors must have been low (
&lt;=10^(-6) M_earth/Myr) to avoid wholesale melting of Earth's crust after
4.4~Ga, and to simultaneously match the number of observed lunar basins. This
conclusion leads to an Hadean eon which is more clement than assumed
previously. Last, after the terrestrial planets had fully formed, the mass in
remnant planetesimals was ~10^(-3) M_earth, lower by at least an order of
magnitude than most previous models suggest. Our dynamically and geochemically
self-consistent scenario requires that future N-body simulations of rocky
planet formation either directly incorporate collisional grinding or rely on
pebble accretion.

complete in stellar mass at each redshift range and efforts are made to
regularise the analysis for all the data. Our study shows negligible mass
segregation in galaxy group environments with absolute gradients of
$\lesssim0.08$ dex and also shows a lack of any redshift evolution. Moreover,
we find that our results at least for the GAMA data are robust to different
halo mass and group centre estimates. Furthermore, the EAGLE data allows us to
probe much fainter luminosities ($r$-band magnitude of 22) as well as
investigate the three-dimensional spatial distribution with intrinsic halo
properties, beyond what the current observational data can offer. In both cases
we find that the fainter EAGLE data show a very mild spatial mass segregation
at $z \leqslant 0.22$, which is again not apparent at higher redshift.
Interestingly, our results are in contrast to some earlier findings using the

intervenes between the phase of slab nuclei and the outer core of uniform

that the fundamental frequencies of such oscillations are almost independent of
the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter, but strongly depend on the
slope parameter of the nuclear symmetry energy $L$. Although the frequencies
are also sensitive to the entrainment effect, i.e., what portion of nucleons
outside bubbles contribute to the oscillations, by having such a portion fixed,
we can successfully fit the calculated fundamental frequencies of torsional
oscillations in the bubble phase inside a star of specific mass and radius as a
function of $L$. By comparing the resultant fitting formula to the frequencies
of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed from the soft-gamma repeaters,
we find that each of the observed low-frequency QPOs can be identified either
as a torsional oscillation in the bubble phase or as a usual crustal

Yet,
one of major issues is the apparent contradiction between linear stability
analysis quoting a flow to be stable and results from experiments and
simulations proving it to be otherwise. There is some success, in particular in
astrophysical systems, based on Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI). However,
MRI requires the system to be weakly magnetized, which is not a feature of
general magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows. Nevertheless, linear perturbations of
such flows are nonnormal in nature which argues for an origin of nonlinearity
therein. The idea is, nonnormal perturbations could produce huge transient
energy growth (TEG), which may lead to non-linearity and further turbulence.
However, so far, nonnormal effects in shear flows have not been explored much
in the presence of magnetic fields. Here, we consider the perturbed
visco-resistive incompressible MHD shear flows with rotation in general.
Basically we consider the magnetized version of Orr-Sommerfeld and Squire
equations and their magnetic analogues in the presence of Coriolis effect. We
solve the equations using a pseudospectral eigenvalue approach. We investigate
the possible emergence of instability and large TEG in three different flows:
the Keplerian, constant angular momentum and plane Couette flows. We show that,
above a certain value of magnetic field, instability and TEG both stop
occurring. We also show that TEG is maximum near the regions of instability in
the wave number space for a given magnetic field and Reynolds number. Rotating
shear flows are ubiquitous in astrophysics, especially accretion disks, where
molecular viscosity is too low to account for observed data. The primary
accepted cause of energy-momentum transport therein is turbulent viscosity.
Hence, these results would have important implications in astrophysics.

$\sigma_8^8$. It is determined by the integral over the halo mass function
multiplied by the total pressure content of clusters, and further convolved by
the cluster gas pressure profile. It has been shown that various feedback
effects can change significantly the pressure profile, strongly affecting the
tSZ power spectrum at high $l$. Energetics arguments and SZ-halo mass scaling
relations suggest feedback is unlikely to significantly change the total
pressure content, making low $l$ tSZ power spectrum more robust against
feedback effects. Furthermore, the separation between the cosmic infrared
background (CIB) and tSZ is more reliable at low $l$. Low $l$ modes are however
probing very small volumes, giving rise to very large non-gaussian sampling
variance errors. By computing the trispectrum contribution we identify
$90&lt;l&lt;250$ as the minimum variance scale where the combined error is minimized.
We extend the work by the Planck collaboration by including a full trispectrum

we compared the properties of 88 X-shape features, 85 barlenses, and the
photometric bulges of 41 non-barred galaxies. Sizes and minor-to-major axis
ratios (b/a) of these structures are compared, and interpreted by means of
synthetic images using N-body simulation models. Barlenses and their parent
galaxies are also divided into different sub-groups. The synthetic images are
analyzed in a similar manner as the observations. This is the first time that
the observed properties of barlenses and X-shape features are compared, over a
large range of galaxy inclinations. Our analysis are consistent with the idea
that barlenses and X-shape features are physically the same phenomenon.
However, which of the two features is observed depends, not only on galaxy
inclination, but also on its central flux concentration. The observed nearly
round face-on barlens morphology is expected when at least a few percents of
the disk mass is in a central component, within a region much smaller than the
size of the barlens itself. We also discuss that the large range of stellar
population ages obtained for the photometric bulges in the literature, are
consistent with our interpretation.

The majority of bright extragalactic gamma-ray sources are blazars.
Only a few radio galaxies have been detected by Fermi/LAT. Recently, the
GHz-peaked spectrum source PKS 1718-649 was confirmed to be gamma-ray bright,
providing further evidence for the existence of a population of gamma-ray loud,
compact radio galaxies. A spectral turnover in the radio spectrum in the MHz to
GHz range is a characteristic feature of these objects, which are thought to be
young due to their small linear sizes. The multiwavelength properties of the
gamma-ray source PMN J1603-4904 suggest that it is a member of this source
class. Aims. The known radio spectrum of PMN J1603-4904 can be described by a
power law above 1 GHz. Using observations from the Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope (GMRT) at 150, 325, and 610 MHz, we investigate the behaviour of the
spectrum at lower frequencies to search for a low-frequency turnover. Methods.
Data from the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS ADR) catalogue and archival GMRT
observations were used to construct the first MHz to GHz spectrum of PMN
J1603-4904. Results. We detect a low-frequency turnover of the spectrum and
measure the peak position at about 490 MHz (rest-frame), which, using the known
relation of peak frequency and linear size, translates into a maximum linear
source size of ~1.4 kpc. Conclusions. The detection of the MHz peak indicates
that PMN J1603-4904 is part of this population of radio galaxies with turnover
frequencies in the MHz to GHz regime. Therefore it can be considered the
second, confirmed object of this kind detected in gamma-rays. Establishing this
gamma-ray source class will help to investigate the gamma-ray production sites
and to test broadband emission models.

<p>A new compression technique named "Dysco" is introduced that consists of two

have a similar distribution; and a quantization and encoding step, which rounds
values to a given quantization scheme using a dithering scheme. Several
non-linear quantization schemes are tested and combined with different methods
for normalizing the data. Four data sets with observations from the LOFAR and
MWA telescopes are processed with different processing strategies and different
combinations of normalization and quantization. The effects of compression are
measured in image plane.
</p>
<p>The noise added by the lossy compression technique acts like normal system
noise. The accuracy of Dysco is depending on the signal-to-noise ratio of the
data: noisy data can be compressed with a smaller loss of image quality. Data
with typical correlator time and frequency resolutions can be compressed by a
factor of 6.4 for LOFAR and 5.3 for MWA observations with less than 1% added

provides a Casacore storage manager and allows transparent encoding and

<p>The technique can be used for LOFAR and MWA to reduce the archival space

determine the column densities and physical characteristics of the gas emitting
these two lines. We then use a chemical model to determine the origin of the

detections to the West. This distribution contrasts that of HNCO, which is
detected more strongly to the West. The SiO emission peak in the East is
similar to the peak of the molecular gas mass traced by CO. HNCO emission is
offset from this peak by as much as 80 pc ( 1"). We compare velocity integrated
line ratios in the East and West. We confirm that SiO emission strongly
dominates in the East, while the reverse is true in the West. We use RADEX to
analyse the possible gas conditions that could produce such emission. We find
that, in both East and West, we cannot constrain a single temperature for the
gas. We run a grid of chemical models of potential shock processes in the CND
and find that SiO is significantly enhanced during a fast (60 km/s) shock but
not during a slow (20 km/s) shock, nor in a gas not subjected to shocks at all.
We find the inverse for HNCO, whose abundance increases during slow shocks and
in warm non-shocked gas. High SiO and low HNCO indicated a fast shock, while
high HNCO and low SiO indicates either a slow shock or warm, dense, non-shocked
gas. The East Knot is therefore likely to contain gas that is heavily shocked.
From chemical modelling, gas in the West Knot may be non-shocked, or maybe
undergoing a much milder shock event. When taking into account RADEX results,
the milder shock event is the more likely of the two scenarios.

paramount importance for the scalability of imaging methods to the big data
setting of the next-generation telescopes. This article sheds new light on
dimensionality reduction from the perspective of the compressed sensing theory
and studies its interplay with imaging algorithms designed in the context of
convex optimization. We propose a post-gridding linear data embedding to the

providing a dimensionality reduction below image size. This embedding preserves
the null space of the measurement operator and hence its sampling properties
are also preserved in light of the compressed sensing theory. We show that this
can be approximated by first computing the dirty image and then applying a
weighted subsampled discrete Fourier transform to obtain the final reduced data
vector. This Fourier dimensionality reduction model ensures a fast
implementation of the full measurement operator, essential for any iterative
image reconstruction method. The proposed reduction also preserves the i.i.d.
Gaussian properties of the original measurement noise. For convex
optimization-based imaging algorithms, this is key to justify the use of the
standard L2-norm as the data fidelity term. Our simulations confirm that this
dimensionality reduction approach can be leveraged by convex optimization
algorithms with no loss in imaging quality relative to reconstructing the image
from the complete visibility data set. MATLAB code implementing the proposed

abundances of neutron-capture elements ([Ba/Fe] = -1.1), and an absolute carbon
abundance A(C) = 6.1; based on either criterion, HE0020-1741 is sub-classified
as a CEMP-no star. We show that the light-element abundance pattern of
HE0020-1741 is consistent with predicted yields from a massive (M = 21.5 Mo),
primordial composition, supernova (SN) progenitor. We also compare the
abundance patterns of other ultra metal-poor stars from the literature with
available measures of C, N, Na, Mg, and Fe abundances with an extensive grid of
SN models (covering the mass range 10 Mo - 100 Mo), in order to probe the
nature of their likely stellar progenitors. Our results suggest that at least
two classes of progenitors are required at [Fe/H] &lt; -4.0, as the abundance
patterns for more than half of the sample studied in this work (7 out of 12

been discovered recently. However, their nature remains debatable. One of the
most promising ideas is the shock-interaction mechanism, but only simplified
semi-analytical models have been applied so far. We simulate light curves for
several Type I SLSN (SLSN-I) models enshrouded by dense, non-hydrogen
circumstellar envelopes, using a multi-group radiation hydrodynamics code that
predicts not only bolometric, but also multicolor light curves. We demonstrate
that the bulk of SLSNe-I including those with relatively narrow light curves
like SN 2010gx or broad ones like PTF09cnd can be explained by the interaction
of the SN ejecta with he CS envelope, though the range of parameters for these
models is rather wide. Moderate explosion energy ($\sim (2 - 4)\cdot 10^{51}$
ergs) is sufficient to explain both narrow and broad SLSN-I light curves, but
ejected mass and envelope mass differ for those two cases. Only 5 to 10
$M_\odot$ of non-hydrogen material is needed to reproduce the light curve of SN
2010gx, while the best model for PTF09cnd is very massive: it contains almost $
50 M_\odot $ in the CS envelope and only $ 5 M_\odot $ in the ejecta. The CS
envelope for each case extends from 10 $R_\odot$ to $\sim 10^5R_\odot$ ($7\cdot
10^{15} $ cm), which is about an order of magnitude larger than typical
photospheric radii of standard SNe near the maximum light. We briefly discuss
possible ways to form such unusual envelopes.

core-collapse supernovae of 20 and 35 M$_\odot$ primordial stars which are
suitable to reproduce the chemical pattern of the SDSS-J102915+172927 star. We
find that the dust mass yield produced from Population III supernovae
explosions is the most important factor which drives the thermal evolution and
the dynamical properties of the halos. Hence, for the specific distributions
relevant in this context, the composition, the dust optical properties, and the
size-range have only minor effects on the results due to similar cooling
functions. We also show that the critical dust mass to enable fragmentation
provided by semi-analytical models should be revised, as we obtain values one
order of magnitude larger. This determines the transition from disk
fragmentation to a more filamentary fragmentation mode, and suggests that
likely more than one single supernova event or efficient dust growth should be

existing and new approaches. Our pipeline consists of two stages: extracting
descriptive features from the light curves and classification using a machine
learning algorithm. Our feature extraction methods vary from model-dependent
techniques, namely SALT2 fits, to more independent techniques fitting
parametric models to curves, to a completely model-independent wavelet
approach. We cover a range of representative machine learning algorithms,
including naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, artificial

simulated multi-band DES light curves from the Supernova Photometric

the Receiver Operating Characteristic as a metric, we find that the SALT2 fits
and the wavelet approach, with the BDTs algorithm, each achieves an AUC of
0.98, where 1 represents perfect classification. We find that a representative
training set is essential for good classification, whatever the feature set or

that by using either the SALT2 or the wavelet feature sets with a BDT

DARKexp, a one shape parameter family, provides very good fits to the shapes of

accompanied by a related, albeit weaker process -- Raman scattering. We analyze
the signatures of Raman scattering imprinted in the reflected light and the
geometric albedo of exoplanets, which could provide information about
atmospheric properties. Raman scattering affects the geometric albedo spectra
of planets in following ways. Firstly, it causes filling-in of strong
absorption lines in the incident radiation, thus producing sharp peaks in the
albedo. Secondly, it shifts the wavelengths of spectral features in the
reflected light causing the so-called Raman ghost lines. Raman scattering can
also cause a broadband reduction of the albedo due to wavelength shifting of a
stellar spectrum with red spectral index. Observing the Raman peaks in the
albedo could be used to measure the column density of gas, thus providing
constrains on the presence of clouds in the atmosphere. Observing the Raman
ghost lines could be used to spectroscopically identify the main scatterer in
the atmosphere, even molecules like H$_2$ or N$_2$ that do not have prominent
spectral signatures in the optical wavelength range. If detected, ghost lines
could also provide information about the temperature of the atmosphere. In this

NuSTAR. We were able to well constrain the lag spectrum with respect to the
softest (0.3--2.3 keV) band: the delay shows increasing lag values reaching a
maximum delay of $\sim$ 12 ms, between 6 and 6.4 keV. After this maximum, the
value of the hard lag drops to 7 ms, followed by a recovery to a plateau at 9
ms for energies above 8 keV. NuSTAR data confirm this trend up to 30 keV, but
the measurements are statistically poorer, and therefore, less constraining.
The lag-energy pattern up to the discontinuity is well described by a
logarithmic function. Assuming this is due to a Compton reverberation
mechanism, we derive a size for the Compton cloud $R_{\rm{cc}}$ $\sim$ 120
$R_{\rm g}$, consistent with previous estimates on the magnetospheric radius.
In this scenario, the sharp discontinuity at $\sim$ 6.5 keV appears difficult

temperature structure of cold wind material shocking with the ambient medium,
creating a large reservoir of hot, X-ray-emitting gas. Chandra resolved this
diffuse emission by observing the Galactic centre for 3 Ms in an X-ray
Visionary Program. This work aims to confront these Chandra observations by
computing the X-ray emission from the hydrodynamic simulations of the colliding
WR winds, amid exploring a variety of SMBH feedback mechanisms. The major
success of the model is that it reproduces the spectral shape from the 2"-5"
ring around the SMBH, where most of the stellar wind material that is
ultimately captured by Sgr A* is shock-heated and thermalised. This naturally
explains that the hot gas comes from colliding WR winds, and that the wind
speeds of these stars are in general well constrained. The flux level of these
spectra, as well as 12"x12" images of 4-9 keV, show the X-ray flux is tied to
the SMBH feedback strength; stronger feedback clears out more hot gas, thereby
decreasing the thermal X-ray emission. The model in which Sgr A* produced an

net posterior distributions that incorporate any model-selection uncertainty.
Our meta-analysis combines 29 different (15 visible and 14 infrared)
photometric measurements of $L_d$ available in the literature; these involve a
broad assortment of observational datasets, MW models and assumptions, and
methodologies, all tabulated herein. Analyzing the visible and infrared

allowing the helioseismic study of the formation of hundreds of active regions,
which would enable us to perform statistical analyses. Our goal is to collate a
uniform data set of emerging active regions observed by the SDO/HMI instrument
suitable for helioseismic analysis up to seven days before emergence. We
restricted the sample to active regions that were visible in the continuum and
emerged into quiet Sun largely avoiding pre-existing magnetic regions. As a
reference data set we paired a control region (CR), with the same latitude and
distance from central meridian, with each emerging active region (EAR). We call
this data set, which is currently comprised of 105 emerging active regions
observed between May 2010 and November 2012, the SDO Helioseismic Emerging
Active Region (SDO/HEAR) survey. To demonstrate the utility of a data set of a
large number of emerging active regions, we measure the relative east-west
velocity of the leading and trailing polarities from the line-of-sight
magnetogram maps during the first day after emergence. The latitudinally
averaged line-of-sight magnetic field of all the EARs shows that, on average,
the leading (trailing) polarity moves in a prograde (retrograde) direction with
a speed of 121 +/- 22 m/s (-70 +/- 13 m/s) relative to the Carrington rotation
rate in the first day. However, relative to the differential rotation of the
surface plasma, the east-west velocity is symmetric, with a mean of 95 +/- 13
m/s. The SDO/HEAR data set will not only be useful for helioseismic studies,
but will also be useful to study other features such as the surface magnetic
field evolution of a large sample of EARs.

into radiation through a variety of processes such as light from stars,
infrared radiation from cosmic dust and gravitational waves from binary black
holes/neutron stars and supernova explosions. The production of this
astrophysical radiation background (ARB) could affect the expansion rate of the
universe and the growth of perturbations. Here, we aim at understanding to
which level one can constraint the ARB using future cosmological observations.
We model the energy transfer from matter to radiation through an effective
interaction between matter and astrophysical radiation. Using future supernova
data from LSST and growth-rate data from Euclid we find that the ARB density
parameter is constrained, at the 95% confidence level, to be
$\Omega_{ar_0}&lt;0.008$. Estimates of the energy density produced by well-known
astrophysical processes give roughly $\Omega_{ar_0}\sim 10^{-6}$. Therefore, we
conclude that cosmological observations will only be able to constrain exotic
or not-well understood sources of radiation.

with magnetically driven disc winds and viscous heating. Methods: We consider
an initially massive disc with ~0.1 Msun to track the evolution from the early
stage of PPDs. We solve the time evolution of surface density and temperature
by taking into account viscous heating and the loss of the mass and the angular
momentum by the disc winds within the framework of a standard alpha model for
accretion discs. Our model parameters, turbulent viscosity, disc wind mass
loss, and disc wind torque, which are adopted from local magnetohydrodynamical
simulations and constrained by the global energetics of the gravitational
accretion, largely depends on the physical condition of PPDs, particularly on
the evolution of the vertical magnetic flux in weakly ionized PPDs. Results:
Although there are still uncertainties concerning the evolution of the vertical
magnetic flux remaining, surface densities show a large variety, depending on
the combination of these three parameters, some of which are very different
from the surface density expected from the standard accretion. When a PPD is in
a "wind-driven accretion" state with the preserved vertical magnetic field, the
radial dependence of the surface density can be positive in the inner region
&lt;1-10 au. The mass accretion rates are consistent with observations, even in
the very low level of magnetohydrodynamical turbulence. Such a positive radial
slope of the surface density gives a great impact on planet formation because
(i)it inhibits the inward drift or even results in the outward drift of
pebble/boulder-sized solid bodies, and (ii) it also makes the inward type-I
migration of proto-planets slower or even reversed. Conclusions: The variety of
our calculated PPDs should yield a wide variety of exoplanet systems.

According to \cite{Marsh:2016uhc}, AR Sco has a mass in the range 0.81-1.29

with a circular equatorial radius of $\sim$ 4080.00 km, corresponding to
central and surface magnetic fields of $B_{c}\sim 0.90\times 10^{13}$ G and
$B_{s}\sim 8.95\times 10^{11}$ G, respectively. More importantly, the star AR
Sco can produce gravitational radiation with amplitude up to $h_{0}= 3.82\times

Keplerian orbits appear naturally as particular solutions to the problem. After
characterizing the orbits independently, a unified form of the solution is

hadrons such as the deuteron, and they could probe new quark-gluon dynamics in
hadron and nuclear physics. In charged-lepton deep inelastic scattering (DIS),
they are studied by the twist-two structure functions $b_1$ and $b_2$. The
HERMES collaboration found unexpectedly large $b_1$ values than a naive
theoretical expectation based on the standard deuteron model. The situation
should be significantly improved in the near future by an approved experiment
to measure $b_1$ at JLab (Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility).
There is also an interesting indication in the HERMES result that finite
antiquark tensor polarization exists. It could play an important role in
solving a mechanism on tensor structure in the quark-gluon level. The
tensor-polarized antiquark distributions are not easily determined from the
charged-lepton DIS; however, they can be measured in a proton-deuteron
Drell-Yan process with a tensor-polarized deuteron target. In this article, we
estimate the tensor-polarization asymmetry for a possible Fermilab
Main-Injector experiment by using optimum tensor-polarized PDFs to explain the
HERMES measurement. We find that the asymmetry is typically a few percent. If
it is measured, it could probe new hadron physics, and such studies could
create an interesting field of high-energy spin physics. In addition, we find
that a significant tensor-polarized gluon distribution should exist due to
$Q^2$ evolution, even if it were zero at a low $Q^2$ scale. The

deepest region of the inner crust of a neutron star. Because this layer
intervenes between the phase of slab nuclei and the outer core of uniform

separately from usual crustal torsional oscillations. We find from eigenmode
analyses for various models of the equation of state of uniform nuclear matter
that the fundamental frequencies of such oscillations are almost independent of
the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter, but strongly depend on the
slope parameter of the nuclear symmetry energy $L$. Although the frequencies
are also sensitive to the entrainment effect, i.e., what portion of nucleons
outside bubbles contribute to the oscillations, by having such a portion fixed,
we can successfully fit the calculated fundamental frequencies of torsional
oscillations in the bubble phase inside a star of specific mass and radius as a
function of $L$. By comparing the resultant fitting formula to the frequencies
of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed from the soft-gamma repeaters,

due to density changes in the neutron fluid. For large nuclear separations $r$
the contributions from nuclear forces to each of these terms are shown to be
nonzero. In the static limit they are equal in magnitude but have opposite
signs and they cancel exactly. We analyze earlier results on effective
interactions in the light of this finding. We consider the properties of
long-wavelength collective modes and, in particular, calculate the degree of
mixing between the lattice phonons and the phonons in the neutron superfluid.
Using microscopic theory, we calculate the net non-Coulombic contribution to
the nucleus--nucleus interaction and show that, for large $r$, the leading term
is due to exchange of two phonons and varies as $1/r^7$: it is an analog of the
Casimir--Polder interaction between neutral atoms.

observables, called quasi distributions, are related to normal distributions.
The quasi distributions are known to contain power-law UV divergences arise
from a Wilson line in the non-local operator, while the normal distributions
only have logatithmic UV divergences. We propose possible method to subtract
the power divegence to make the matching of the quasi with the normal

considerable large isospin asymmetry or isospin chemical potential, isospin
splittings of constituent mass, chiral phase transition boundary, and critical
point for $u$ and $d$ quarks can be observed for positive isovector coupling
constants but are suppressed for negative ones. The quark matter symmetry
energy decreases with the increasing isovector coupling constant, and is mostly
enhanced in the pNJL model than in the NJL model. A positive scalar-isovector
coupling constant is more likely to lead to an unstable isospin asymmetric
quark matter. The isovector coupling has been further found to affect particle

coupled, anisotropic non-Abelian plasmas in the presence of strong magnetic
fields. We compute the anisotropic heavy quark drag forces and Langevin
diffusion coefficients and also the anisotropic shear viscosities for two
different holographic models, namely, a top-down deformation of strongly
coupled $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory triggered by an
external Abelian magnetic field, and a bottom-up Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD)
model which is able to provide a quantitative description of lattice QCD
thermodynamics with $(2+1)$-flavors at both zero and nonzero magnetic fields.
We find that, in general, energy loss and momentum diffusion through strongly
coupled anisotropic plasmas are enhanced by a magnetic field being larger in
transverse directions than in the direction parallel to the magnetic field.
Moreover, the anisotropic shear viscosity coefficient is smaller in the
direction of the magnetic field than in the plane perpendicular to the field,
which indicates that strongly coupled anisotropic plasmas become closer to the
perfect fluid limit along the magnetic field. We also present, in the context
of the EMD model, holographic predictions for the entropy density and the
crossover critical temperature in a wider region of the $(T,B)$ phase diagram
that has not yet been covered by lattice simulations. Our results for the
transport coefficients in the phenomenologically realistic magnetic EMD model
could be readily used as inputs in numerical codes for magnetohydrodynamics.

hadrons such as the deuteron, and they could probe new quark-gluon dynamics in
hadron and nuclear physics. In charged-lepton deep inelastic scattering (DIS),
they are studied by the twist-two structure functions $b_1$ and $b_2$. The
HERMES collaboration found unexpectedly large $b_1$ values than a naive
theoretical expectation based on the standard deuteron model. The situation
should be significantly improved in the near future by an approved experiment
to measure $b_1$ at JLab (Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility).
There is also an interesting indication in the HERMES result that finite
antiquark tensor polarization exists. It could play an important role in
solving a mechanism on tensor structure in the quark-gluon level. The
tensor-polarized antiquark distributions are not easily determined from the
charged-lepton DIS; however, they can be measured in a proton-deuteron
Drell-Yan process with a tensor-polarized deuteron target. In this article, we
estimate the tensor-polarization asymmetry for a possible Fermilab
Main-Injector experiment by using optimum tensor-polarized PDFs to explain the
HERMES measurement. We find that the asymmetry is typically a few percent. If
it is measured, it could probe new hadron physics, and such studies could
create an interesting field of high-energy spin physics. In addition, we find
that a significant tensor-polarized gluon distribution should exist due to
$Q^2$ evolution, even if it were zero at a low $Q^2$ scale. The
tensor-polarized gluon distribution has never been observed, so that it is an
interesting future project.

toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds. We use mirror symmetry to improve our understanding
of this correspondence and to provide a systematic approach for constructing
brane brick models starting from geometry. The mirror configuration consists of
D5-branes wrapping 4-spheres and the gauge theory is determined by how they
intersect. We also explain how $2d$ $(0,2)$ triality is realized in terms of
geometric transitions in the mirror geometry. Mirror symmetry leads to a
geometric unification of dualities in different dimensions, where the order of
duality is $n-1$ for a Calabi-Yau $n$-fold. This makes us conjecture the
existence of a quadrality symmetry in $0d$. Finally, we comment on how the

into account in relativistic physics: a geometric time, which emanates from the
structure of spacetime and its metrics, and a causal time, indicating the flow
from the past to the future. A particularity of causal times is that its values
have no intrinsic meaning, as their evolution alone is meaningful. In the
context of relativistic Lagrangian mechanics, causal times corresponds to
admissible parameterizations of paths, and we show that in order for a
langragian to not depend on any particular causal time (as its values have no
intrinsic meaning), it has to be homogeneous in its velocity argument. We
illustrate this property with the example of a free particle in a potential.
Then, using a geometric Lagrangian (i.e. a parameterization independent
Lagrangian which is also manifestly covariant), we introduce the notion of
ageodesicity of a path which measures to what extent a path is far from being a
geodesic, and show how the notion can be used in the twin paradox to
differentiate the paths followed by the two twins.

superintegrable. We study here this problem in the case of natural Hamiltonians
with constants of motion quadratic in the momenta. The procedure of
quantization here considered, transforms the Hamiltonian into the
Laplace-Beltrami operator plus a scalar potential. In order to transform the
constants of motion into symmetry operators of the quantum Hamiltonian,
additional scalar potentials, known as quantum corrections, must be introduced,

condition on states of a quantum communication network that contains "backward
time-steps" in some of its branches. It has been argued that this is an
analogue for quantum processes in the presence of closed timelike curves
(CTCs). The unusual properties of states of quantum communication networks that
fulfill the D-CTC condition have been discussed extensively in recent
literature. In this work, the D-CTC condition is investigated in the framework
of quantum field theory in the local, operator-algebraic approach due to Haag
and Kastler. It is shown that the D-CTC condition cannot be fulfilled in states
which are analytic for the energy, or satisfy the Reeh-Schlieder property, for
a certain class of processes and initial conditions. On the other hand, if a
quantum field theory admits sufficiently many uncorrelated states across
acausally related spacetime regions (as implied by the split property), then
the D-CTC condition can always be fulfilled approximately to arbitrary
precision. As this result pertains to quantum field theory on globally
hyperbolic spacetimes where CTCs are absent, one may conclude that interpreting
the D-CTC condition as characteristic for quantum processes in the presence of
CTCs could be misleading, and should be regarded with caution. Furthermore, a
construction of the quantized massless Klein-Gordon field on the Politzer
spacetime, often viewed as spacetime analogue for quantum communication
networks with backward time-steps, is proposed in this work.

descriptions: (1) canonical quantum theory (CQT) combined with the Newtonian
limit of GR, (2) objective collapse theories (OCTs) extended to the regime of
semiclassical Newtonian gravity, and (3) OCTs extended to incorporate quantized
Newtonian gravity. For the CQT approach, we follow the treatment of Hu and
Anastopoulos in [2]. For the OCTs, we consider the GRW, CSL, DP, and Karolyhazy

Tilloy-Diosi [4], respectively, and we consider the most straightforward
extension of the aforementioned OCTs to the regime of quantized Newtonian

experimentally discriminate the quantum jumps in gravitational cat states
predicted by the CQT approach and the quantized-gravity OCTs (which we show
make effectively the same predictions as each other), from the predictions of
the semiclassical-gravitational OCTs. We also show that the GRW and Karolyhazy

The linear map that implements it, referred to as the Q-transform, enables a

<p>The second set of results pertains to a generalization of the basic

analytic solution for the reduced qubit dynamics that holds in the presence of
an arbitrary Gaussian environment and dephasing-preserving control. Our

that the applied control sequences obey specific timing symmetries, so that a
frequency comb emerges in the Fourier domain for all the relevant (first- and
second-order) filter functions, allowing the spectra of interest to be sampled
and related to observable quantities. In particular, our protocols enable us to
reconstruct asymmetric spectra associated with non-classical environments.
These quantum spectra have distinctive dynamical signatures, which we explore
in two paradigmatic open-system models describing spin and charge qubits

infinite-dimensional and the states are typically represented in phase space.
For the particular case of binary coherent state alphabets these otherwise

efficient distribution of entanglement and generation of completely secure

optimal rates without quantum repeaters? Our work solves this basic question
for two remote parties connected by a quantum channel in the most relevant
practical scenarios, without imposing any restriction on their classical
communication, which can be unlimited and two-way. To achieve our results, we
first extend the notion of relative entropy of entanglement from quantum states
to channels, proving a general upper bound for all the two-way assisted
capacities. Then, we design a novel technique, dubbed 'teleportation
stretching', which reduces the most general adaptive protocols for quantum or
private communication to a simple block form. In this way, we can simplify our
upper bound to a single-letter expression for many fundamental channels,
establishing exact formulas for the two-way assisted capacities of bosonic
lossy channels, quantum-limited amplifiers, dephasing and erasure channels in
arbitrary dimension. In particular, we determine the fundamental rate-loss
scaling which affects any quantum optical communication, e.g., for
long-distance quantum key distribution. By setting these limits, we also
establish the most general and correct benchmarks for testing the performance
of quantum repeaters.

Stochastic Systems (LQSSs) is of fundamental importance for the practical
applications of such systems, especially as coherent controllers for other
quantum systems. So far, most works that addressed this problem have used
cascade realizations. In this work, a new method is proposed, where the
transfer function of a LQSS is realized by a series of a pre-processing linear
static network, a reduced LQSS, and a post-processing linear static network.
The introduction of the pre- and post-processing static networks leaves an
intermediate reduced LQSS with a simple input/output structure, that is
realized by a concatenation of simple cavities. A feedback connection of the
cavities through a linear static network is used to produce the correct
dynamics for the reduced system. The resulting realization provides a nice

capabilities of a quantum channel. The main conceptual development builds
firmly on the notion of a private state, which is a powerful, uniquely quantum
method for simplifying the tripartite picture of privacy involving local
operations and public classical communication to a bipartite picture of quantum
privacy involving local operations and classical communication. This approach
has previously led to some of the strongest upper bounds on secret key rates,
including the squashed entanglement and the relative entropy of entanglement.
Here we use this approach along with a "privacy test" to establish a general
meta-converse bound for private communication, which has a number of
applications. The meta-converse allows for proving that any quantum channel's
relative entropy of entanglement is a strong converse rate for private
communication. For covariant channels, the meta-converse also leads to
second-order expansions of relative entropy of entanglement bounds for private
communication rates. For such channels, the bounds also apply to the private
communication setting in which the sender and receiver are assisted by
unlimited public classical communication, and as such, they are relevant for
establishing various converse bounds for quantum key distribution protocols
conducted over these channels. We find precise characterizations for several
channels of interest and apply the methods to establish several converse bounds
on the private transmission capabilities of all phase-insensitive bosonic
channels.

collapse of the wavefunction, which yields a precisely defined outcome. On the
other hand, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that incompatible
observables, such as position and momentum, cannot both take on arbitrarily
precise values. But how does a wavefunction evolve when two such quantities are
probed simultaneously, and how does the uncertainty principle dynamically
inhibit precise measurement outcomes? To realize this unexplored regime, we
simultaneously apply two continuous quantum non-demolition probes of
non-commuting observables on a superconducting qubit. We achieve this
capability by developing a novel measurement scheme that allows us to control
the axes of multiple readout channels. We show that the uncertainty principle
directly governs the dynamics of the state, and consequently standard
wavefunction collapse is replaced by a persistent diffusion that exhibits
several distinct regimes. Although evolution of the state now differs
drastically from that of a conventional measurement, information about both
non-commuting observables is extracted by keeping track of the time ordering of
the measurement record, enabling quantum state tomography without alternating

rapid state purification, adaptive measurement, measurement-based state

their uniquely quantum emission and phenomenon of two-photon interference
allowing for the generation and transfer of nonclassical states. Although a few
analytical methods have been briefly investigated for describing pulsed
single-photon sources, these methods apply only to either perfectly ideal or at
least extremely idealized sources. Here, we present the first complete picture
of pulsed single-photon sources by elaborating how to numerically and fully
characterize non-ideal single-photon sources operating in a pulsed regime. In
order to achieve this result, we make the connection between quantum
Monte-Carlo simulations, experimental characterizations, and an extended form
of the quantum regression theorem. We elaborate on how an ideal pulsed
single-photon source is connected to its photocount distribution and its
measured degree of second- and first-order optical coherence. By doing so, we
provide a description of the relationship between instantaneous source
correlations and the typical experimental interferometers (Hanbury-Brown and
Twiss, Hong-Ou-Mandel, and Mach-Zehnder) used to characterize such sources.
Then, we use these techniques to explore several prototypical quantum systems
and their non-ideal behaviors. As an example numerical result, we show that for
the most popular single-photon source---a resonantly excited two-level
system---its error probability is directly related to its excitation pulse
length. We believe that the intuition gained from these representative systems
and characters can be used to interpret future results with more complicated
source Hamiltonians and behaviors. Finally, we have thoroughly documented our

analogue for quantum processes in the presence of closed timelike curves
(CTCs). The unusual properties of states of quantum communication networks that
fulfill the D-CTC condition have been discussed extensively in recent
literature. In this work, the D-CTC condition is investigated in the framework
of quantum field theory in the local, operator-algebraic approach due to Haag

which are analytic for the energy, or satisfy the Reeh-Schlieder property, for
a certain class of processes and initial conditions. On the other hand, if a
quantum field theory admits sufficiently many uncorrelated states across
acausally related spacetime regions (as implied by the split property), then
the D-CTC condition can always be fulfilled approximately to arbitrary

the D-CTC condition as characteristic for quantum processes in the presence of

the logistics of censuses and surveys. Consequently, spatially detailed changes
across scales of days, weeks, or months, or even year to year, are difficult to
assess; thus the speed of which policies can be designed and evaluated is
limited. However, recent studies have shown the value of mobile phone data as
an enabling methodology for demographic modeling and measurement. In this work,
we investigate whether indicators extracted from mobile phone usage can reveal
information about the socio-economical status of microregions such as districts
(i.e., average spatial resolution &lt; 2.7km). For this we examine anonymized
mobile phone metadata combined with beneficiaries records from unemployment
benefit program. We find that aggregated activity, social, and mobility
patterns strongly correlate with unemployment. Furthermore, we construct a
simple model to produce accurate reconstruction of district level unemployment
from their mobile communication patterns alone. Our results suggest that
reliable and cost-effective economical indicators could be built based on
passively collected and anonymized mobile phone data. With similar data being
collected every day by telecommunication services across the world,
survey-based methods of measuring community socioeconomic status could
potentially be augmented or replaced by such passive sensing methods in the
future.

columns of a matrix. Ideally, given the leverage scores of a rank-$r$ matrix
$M\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, that matrix can be reliably completed from just
$O(rn\log^{2}n)$ samples if the samples are chosen randomly from a nonuniform
distribution induced by the leverage scores. In practice, however, the leverage
scores are often unknown a priori. As such, the sample complexity in standard
matrix completion---using uniform random sampling---increases to
$O(\eta(M)\cdot rn\log^{2}n)$, where $\eta(M)$ is the largest leverage score of
$M$. In this paper, we propose a two-phase algorithm called
$\operatorname{MC}^2$ for matrix completion: in the first phase, the leverage
scores are estimated based on uniform random samples, and then in the second
phase the matrix is resampled nonuniformly based on the estimated leverage
scores and then completed. The total sample complexity of $\operatorname{MC}^2$
is provably smaller than standard matrix completion---substantially so for
coherent but well-conditioned matrices. In fact, the dependence on condition
number appears to be an artifact of the proof techniques, as numerical
simulations suggest that the algorithm outperforms standard matrix completion
in a much broader class of matrices.

antennas at the base station must achieve high throughput and low error rate at
low complexity. Since the complexity of maximum-likelihood (ML) data detection
is prohibitive for such large wireless systems, approximate methods are
necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel data detection algorithm referred
to as Triangular Approximate SEmidefinite Relaxation (TASER), which is suitable
for two application scenarios: (i) coherent data detection in large multi-user
multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) wireless systems and (ii) joint
channel estimation and data detection in large single-input multiple-output
(SIMO) wireless systems. For both scenarios, we show that TASER achieves
near-ML error-rate performance at low complexity by relaxing the associated
ML-detection problems into a semidefinite program, which we solve approximately
using a preconditioned forward-backward splitting procedure. Since the
resulting problem is non-convex, we provide convergence guarantees for our
algorithm. To demonstrate the efficacy of TASER in practice, we design a
systolic architecture that enables our algorithm to achieve high throughput at
low hardware complexity, and we develop reference field-programmable gate array
(FPGA) and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs for various

through the AdaBoost training procedure, we can focus more on the patches (face

that security and service level agreements (SLAs) are key concerns in respect

content delivery in wireless networks. Wireless caching differs from
traditional web caching in that it can exploit the broadcast nature of wireless
medium and hence opportunistically change the network topologies. This paper
studies the fundamental limits of caching in a MIMO interference network with 3
cache-aided transmitters each equipped with M antennas and 3 cache-aided
receivers each with N antennas. The performance is characterized by fractional
delivery time (FDT), an information theoretic metric evaluating the worst-case
relative delivery time with respect to a point-to-point baseline system without
cache. By using a newly proposed cooperative Tx/Rx caching strategy for file
placement, the MIMO interference network during content delivery is turned to
hybrid forms of MIMO X channel and MIMO multicast channel with partial or full
transmit cooperation. We derive the degrees of freedom (DoF) of these channels
through linear precoding based interference management schemes. Based on these
results, we obtain an achievable FDT for arbitrary M, N and any feasible cache
sizes. The achievable FDT is optimal at certain antenna configurations and
cache size regions, and is within a multiplicative gap of 3 from the optimum at
other cases.

novelty is that the size of signal ensembles will be taken into consideration
in our analysis to theoretically show that MMVs indeed exhibit better
performance than SMV. Although our concept can be broadly applied to CS
algorithms with MMVs, the case study conducted on a well-known greedy solver
called simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) will be explored in this

the design of Massive MIMO wireless systems, due to the length of the training
sequences required to distinguish the antennas (in the downlink) and the users
(for the uplink where a given spectral resource can be shared by a large number
of users). In this article, we focus on the downlink CSI estimation case.
Considering the presence of spatial correlation at the base transceiver station
(BTS) side, and assuming that the per-user channel statistics are known, we
seek to exploit this correlation to minimize the length of the pilot sequences.
We introduce a scheme relying on non-orthogonal pilot sequences and feedback
from the user terminal (UT), which enables the BTS to estimate all downlink
channels. Thanks to the relaxed orthogonality assumption on the pilots, the
length of the obtained pilot sequences can be strictly lower than the number of
antennas at the BTS, while the CSI estimation error is kept arbitrarily small.
We introduce two algorithms to dynamically design the required pilot sequences,
analyze and validate the performance of the proposed CSI estimation method
through numerical simulations using a realistic scenario based on the one-ring
channel model.

representations and operations is still unclear in traditional eliminative
connectionism. Therefore, we suggest a unique perspective on this central
issue, to which we would like to refer as to transparent connectionism, by
proposing accounts of how symbolic computation can be implemented in neural
substrates. In this study we first introduce a new model of dynamics on a
symbolic space, the versatile shift, showing that it supports the real-time
simulation of a range of automata. We then show that the Goedelization of
versatile shifts defines nonlinear dynamical automata, dynamical systems
evolving on a vectorial space. Finally, we present a mapping between nonlinear
dynamical automata and recurrent artificial neural networks. The mapping
defines an architecture characterized by its granular modularity, where data,
symbolic operations and their control are not only distinguishable in
activation space, but also spatially localizable in the network itself, while
maintaining a distributed encoding of symbolic representations. The resulting
networks simulate automata in real-time and are programmed directly, in absence
of network training. To discuss the unique characteristics of the architecture
and their consequences, we present two examples: i) the design of a Central
Pattern Generator from a finite-state locomotive controller, and ii) the
creation of a network simulating a system of interactive automata that supports
the parsing of garden-path sentences as investigated in psycholinguistics

Hidden Markov Model. The algorithm is trained and tested on the VidTimit

Secondly, the result confirms that 3D feature extraction methods improve the

general Wi-Fi monetization model for public Wi-Fi hotspots deployed by venue
owners (VOs), who generate revenue from providing both the premium Wi-Fi access
and the advertising sponsored Wi-Fi access to mobile users (MUs). With the
premium access, MUs directly pay VOs for their Wi-Fi usage; while with the
advertising sponsored access, MUs watch advertisements in exchange of the free
usage of Wi-Fi. VOs sell their ad spaces to advertisers (ADs) via an ad
platform, and share a proportion of the revenue with the ad platform. We
formulate the economic interactions among the ad platform, VOs, MUs, and ADs as
a three-stage Stackelberg game. We characterize the game equilibrium, and show
that the ad platform's advertising revenue sharing policy will affect the VOs'
Wi-Fi prices but not the VOs' advertising prices. Moreover, we investigate the
impacts of the MU visiting frequency and the advertising concentration level on
the equilibrium. Our analysis indicates that both the VOs' Wi-Fi prices and
advertising prices are non-decreasing in the advertising concentration level
and non-increasing in the MU visiting frequency. Numerical results show that
the VOs are capable of generating large revenues through mainly providing one

depending on their advertising concentration levels and MU visiting
frequencies.

we propose a novel spectrum sharing framework for the coopetition (i.e.,
cooperation and competition) between LTE and Wi-Fi in the unlicensed band.
Basically, the LTE network can choose to work in one of the two modes: in the
competition mode, it randomly accesses an unlicensed channel, and interferes
with the Wi-Fi access point using the same channel; in the cooperation mode, it
delivers traffic for the Wi-Fi users in exchange for the exclusive access of
the corresponding channel. Because the LTE network works in an
interference-free manner in the cooperation mode, it can achieve a much larger
data rate than that in the competition mode, which allows it to effectively
serve both its own users and the Wi-Fi users. We design a second-price reverse
auction mechanism, which enables the LTE provider and the Wi-Fi access point
owners (APOs) to effectively negotiate the operation mode. Specifically, the
LTE provider is the auctioneer (buyer), and the APOs are the bidders (sellers)
who compete to sell their channel access opportunities to the LTE provider. In
Stage I of the auction, the LTE provider announces a reserve rate. In Stage II
of the auction, the APOs submit their bids. We show that the auction involves
allocative externalities, i.e., the cooperation between the LTE provider and
one APO benefits other APOs who are not directly involved in this cooperation.
As a result, a particular APO's willingness to cooperate is affected by its
belief about other APOs' willingness to cooperate. This makes our analysis much
more challenging than that of the conventional second-price auction, where
bidding truthfully is a weakly dominant strategy. We show that the APOs have a
unique form of the equilibrium bidding strategies in Stage II, based on which
we analyze the LTE provider's optimal reserve rate in Stage I.

popularity, the current SNE methods experience the "crowding problem" when the
data include highly imbalanced similarities. This implies that the data points
with higher total similarity tend to get crowded around the display center. To
solve this problem, we normalize the similarity matrix to be doubly stochastic
such that all the data points have equal total similarities. A fast

theoretically that the doubly stochasticity constraint often leads to
approximately spherical embeddings. This suggests replacing a flat space with

bibliographic data that is suitable for the Semantic Web. We examine the Entity
Relationship (ER) model, which has been selected by IFLA as a "conceptual
framework" in order to model the FR family (FRBR, FRAD, and RDA), and the
problems ER causes as we move towards the Semantic Web. Subsequently, while
maintaining the semantics of the aforementioned standards but rejecting the ER
as a conceptual framework for bibliographic data, this paper builds on the RDF
(Resource Description Framework) potential and documents how both the RDF and
Linked Data's rationale can affect the way we model bibliographic data. In this
way, a new approach to bibliographic data emerges where the distinction between
description and authorities is obsolete. Instead, the integration of the
authorities with descriptive information becomes fundamental so that a network
of correlations can be established between the entities and the names by which
the entities are known. Naming is a vital issue for human cultures because
names are not random sequences of characters or sounds that stand just as
identifiers for the entities; they also have socio-cultural meanings and
interpretations. Thus, instead of describing indivisible resources, we could
describe entities that appear in a variety of names on various resources. In
this study, a method is proposed to connect the names with the entities they
represent and, in this way, to document the provenance of these names by
connecting specific resources with specific names.

Darwinian evolution. Investigating the consequences of self-modification, and
more precisely, the consequences of utility function self-modification, leads
to the stronger claim that not only human, but any form of intelligence is
ultimately only possible within evolutionary processes. Human-designed
artificial intelligences can only remain stable until they discover how to
manipulate their own utility function. By definition, a human designer cannot
prevent a superhuman intelligence from modifying itself, even if protection
mechanisms against this action are put in place. Without evolutionary pressure,
sufficiently advanced artificial intelligences become inert by simplifying
their own utility function. Within evolutionary processes, the implicit utility
function is always reducible to persistence, and the control of superhuman
intelligences embedded in evolutionary processes is not possible. Mechanisms
against utility function self-modification are ultimately futile. Instead,
scientific effort toward the mitigation of existential risks from the
development of superintelligences should be in two directions: understanding
consciousness, and the complex dynamics of evolutionary systems.

Working in this emerging field requires comprehension of an array of

Most of the financial institutions internationally have been implementing

AML, the customer identification is an important task which helps AML experts
to monitor customer habits: some being customer domicile, transactions that
they are involved in etc. However, simple query tools provided by current DBMS
as well as naive approaches in customer searching may produce incorrect and
ambiguous results and their processing time is also very high due to the

are now widely used to eliminate the haze effects from individual images.
However, even the state-of-the-art dehazing algorithms may not provide
sufficient support to video analytics, as a crucial pre-processing step for
video-based decision making systems (e.g., robot navigation), due to the
limitations of these algorithms on poor result coherence and low processing

video dehazing, to output coherent results in real time, with two novel
techniques. Firstly, we decompose the dehazing algorithms into three generic
components, namely transmission map estimator, atmospheric light estimator and
haze-free image generator. They can be simultaneously processed by multiple
threads in the distributed system, such that the processing efficiency is
optimized by automatic CPU resource allocation based on the workloads.
Secondly, a cross-frame normalization scheme is proposed to enhance the
coherence among consecutive frames, by sharing the parameters of atmospheric
light from consecutive frames in the distributed computation platform. The

It
is an open question how real spiking neurons produce the kind of powerful
neural computation that is possible with deep artificial neural networks, using
only so very few spikes to communicate. Building on recent insights in
neuroscience, we present an Adapting Spiking Neural Network (ASNN) based on
adaptive spiking neurons. These spiking neurons efficiently encode information
in spike-trains using a form of Asynchronous Pulsed Sigma-Delta coding while
homeostatically optimizing their firing rate. In the proposed paradigm of
spiking neuron computation, neural adaptation is tightly coupled to synaptic
plasticity, to ensure that downstream neurons can correctly decode upstream
spiking neurons. We show that this type of network is inherently able to carry
out asynchronous and event-driven neural computation, while performing
identical to corresponding artificial neural networks (ANNs). In particular, we
show that these adaptive spiking neurons can be drop in replacements for ReLU
neurons in standard feedforward ANNs comprised of such units. We demonstrate
that this can also be successfully applied to a ReLU based deep convolutional
neural network for classifying the MNIST dataset. The ASNN thus outperforms
current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) implementations, while responding (up
to) an order of magnitude faster and using an order of magnitude fewer spikes.
Additionally, in a streaming setting where frames are continuously classified,
we show that the ASNN requires substantially fewer network updates as compared

behavior in non-reversible stochastic processes. While our method is general,
it is strongly motivated by discrete simulations of ordinary differential
equations representing non-reversible biological processes, in particular
molecular simulations. Here, the discrete time steps of the simulation are
often very small compared to the time scale of interest, i.e., of the whole
process. In this setting, the detection of a global cyclic behavior of the
process becomes difficult because transitions between individual states may
appear almost reversible on the small time scale of the simulation. We address
this difficulty using a mixed-integer programming model that allows us to
compute a cycle of clusters with maximum net flow, i.e., large forward and
small backward probability. For a synthetic genetic regulatory network
consisting of a ring-oscillator with three genes, we show that this approach
can detect the most productive overall cycle, outperforming classical spectral
analysis methods. Our method applies to general non-equilibrium steady state
systems such as catalytic reactions, for which the objective value computes the

hardware-based data compression within the memory hierarchy, including on-chip
caches, main memory, and both on-chip and off-chip interconnects. This new
approach is fast, simple, and effective in saving storage space. A key insight
in our approach is that access time (including decompression latency) is
critical in modern memory hierarchies. By combining inexpensive hardware
support with modest OS support, our holistic approach to compression achieves
substantial improvements in performance and energy efficiency across the memory
hierarchy. Using this new approach, we make several major contributions in this
thesis. First, we propose a new compression algorithm, Base-Delta-Immediate
Compression (BDI), that achieves high compression ratio with very low
compression/decompression latency. BDI exploits the existing low dynamic range
of values present in many cache lines to compress them to smaller sizes using
Base+Delta encoding. Second, we observe that the compressed size of a cache
block can be indicative of its reuse. We use this observation to develop a new
cache insertion policy for compressed caches, the Size-based Insertion Policy
(SIP), which uses the size of a compressed block as one of the metrics to
predict its potential future reuse. Third, we propose a new main memory
compression framework, Linearly Compressed Pages (LCP), that significantly
reduces the complexity and power cost of supporting main memory compression. We
demonstrate that any compression algorithm can be adapted to fit the
requirements of LCP, and that LCP can be efficiently integrated with the
existing cache compression designs, avoiding extra compression/decompression.

wavelet coefficients exhibit a rooted tree structure can be recovered using
specially-adapted compressed sensing algorithms from just n=O(k) measurements,
where k is the sparsity of the signal. Motivated by these results, we introduce
a simplified proportional-dimensional asymptotic framework which enables the
quantitative evaluation of recovery guarantees for tree-based compressed
sensing. In the context of Gaussian matrices, we apply this framework to
existing worst-case analysis of the Iterative Tree Projection (ITP) algorithm
which makes use of the tree-based Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). Within
the same framework, we then obtain quantitative results based on a new method
of analysis, recently introduced in [Cartis and Thompson, 2015], which
considers the fixed points of the algorithm. By exploiting the realistic
average-case assumption that the measurements are statistically independent of
the signal, we obtain significant quantitative improvements when compared to
the tree-based RIP analysis. Our results have a refreshingly simple
interpretation, explicitly determining a bound on the number of measurements
that are required as a multiple of the sparsity. For example we prove that
exact recovery of binary tree-based signals from noiseless Gaussian
measurements is asymptotically guaranteed for ITP with constant stepsize
provided n&gt;50k. All our results extend to the more realistic case in which

are more influential than others, using a parametric Hawkes process model. We
find that tie strength plays an important role: densely embedded social ties

We propose a new market-based framework for pricing computational tasks in the

The agent takes data and computational tasks from users, estimates time and

(MISO) Gaussian broadcast channel~(BC), in which channel state information
(CSI) is available at both the transmitter and the receivers. The flexible and
explicit design of a uniquely decomposable constellation group (UDCG) is
provided based on pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and rectangular quadrature
amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations. With this, a modulation division
(MD) transmission scheme is developed for the MISO BC. The proposed MD scheme
enables each receiver to uniquely and efficiently detect their desired signals
from the superposition of mutually interfering cochannel signals in the absence
of noise. In our design, the optimal transmitter beamforming problem is solved
in a closed-form for two-user MISO BC using max-min fairness as a design
criterion. Then, for a general case with more than two receivers, we develop a
user-grouping-based beamforming scheme, where the grouping method, beamforming
vector design and power allocation problems are addressed by using weighted
max-min fairness. It is shown that our proposed approach has a lower
probability of error compared with the zero-forcing (ZF) method when the
Hermitian angle between the two channel vectors is small in a two-user case. In
addition, simulation results also reveal that for the general channel model
with more than two users, our user-grouping-based scheme significantly
outperforms the ZF, time division (TD), minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and
signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR) based techniques in moderate and high
SNR regimes when the number of users approaches to the number of base station
(BS) antennas and it degrades into the ZF scheme when the number of users is
far less than the number of BS antennas in Rayleigh fading channels.

(MT) channels by analyzing three different modulation techniques. The first
requires transmitter-receiver synchronization and is based on modulating
information on the release timing of information particles. The other two are
asynchronous and are based on modulating information on the relative time
between two consecutive releases of information particles using
indistinguishable or distinguishable particles. All modulation schemes result
in a system that relate the transmitted and the received signals through an
additive noise, which follows a stable distribution. As the common notion of
the variance of a signal is not suitable for defining the power of stable
distributed signals (due to infinite variance), we derive an expression for the
geometric power of a large class of stable distributions, and then use this
result to characterize the geometric signal-to-noise ratio (G-SNR) for each of
the modulation techniques. In addition, for binary communication, we derive the
optimal detection rules for each modulation technique. Numerical evaluations
indicate that the bit error rate (BER) is constant for a given G-SNR, and the
performance gain obtained by using synchronized communication is significant.
Yet, it is also shown that by using two distinguishable particles per bit
instead of one, the BER of the asynchronous technique can approach that of the
synchronous one.

plot summaries, news articles, blog posts, etc. Recommendation approaches based
on latent factor models can be extended naturally to leverage text by employing
an explicit mapping from text to factors. This enables recommendations for new,
unseen content, and may generalize better, since the factors for all items are
produced by a compactly-parametrized model. Previous work has used topic models
or averages of word embeddings for this mapping. In this paper we present a
method leveraging deep recurrent neural networks to encode the text sequence
into a latent vector, specifically gated recurrent units (GRUs) trained
end-to-end on the collaborative filtering task. For the task of scientific
paper recommendation, this yields models with significantly higher accuracy. In
cold-start scenarios, we beat the previous state-of-the-art, all of which
ignore word order. Performance is further improved by multi-task learning,
where the text encoder network is trained for a combination of content

wireless network modeled as a two-layered interference network. The first layer
of the interference network is the backhaul layer between macro base stations
(MB) and small cell base stations (SB), which is modeled as a Wyner type linear
network. The second layer is the transmission layer between SBs and mobile
terminals (MTs), which is modeled as a linear Wyner $L_T$ network, i.e., each
MT is connected to $L_T+1$ SBs. The SBs are assumed to be half-duplex, thus
restricting the per user degrees of freedom (puDoF) in the system to $1/2$. The
puDoF can be further restricted by the number of antennas at the MB. %For $L_T
\in \{1,2\}$, the puDoF is limited by the interference in the backhaul layer
and the number of antennas at each MB. By increasing the number of antennas at
the MBs, the achievable puDoF can be increased up to $1/2$. The optimal puDoF
in this case can be achieved by using simple interference avoidance schemes.
For $L_T \in \{1,2\}$, the optimal puDoF can be achieved by using simple
interference avoidance schemes. The increase in the connectivity of
transmission layer beyond $L_T=2$ limits the achievable puDoF using only
zero-forcing schemes to $\frac{2}{2+L_T}$, even in the presence of large number
of antennas at each MB but the optimal puDoF can be achieved by making each
message available at multiple SBs. This is done by sending an appropriate
linear combination to the SB to zero-force interference at the intended user. A
maximum per user DoF of half can be achieved in the linear network with
sufficient number of antennas using only interference avoidance schemes. This
is found to be true for the cellular network as well.

However wireless channels have limited diversity in practice, dictated by their

Bresler et al show that the number of degrees of freedom achievable with vector

inversely proportional to $L$. In this paper, we show that when $K\geq4$, the

challenging due to its inherent multiscale nature. Currently, the highest
resolution NWP models use a horizontal resolution of about 10km. In order to
increase the resolution of NWP models highly scalable atmospheric models are
needed.
</p>
<p>The Non-hydrostatic Unified Model of the Atmosphere (NUMA), developed by the
authors at the Naval Postgraduate School, was designed to achieve this purpose.
NUMA is used by the Naval Research Laboratory, Monterey as the engine inside
its next generation weather prediction system NEPTUNE. NUMA solves the fully
compressible Navier-Stokes equations by means of high-order Galerkin methods
(both spectral element as well as discontinuous Galerkin methods can be used).
Mesh generation is done using the p4est library. NUMA is capable of running
middle and upper atmosphere simulations since it does not make use of the
shallow-atmosphere approximation.
</p>
<p>This paper presents the performance analysis and optimization of the spectral
element version of NUMA. The performance at different optimization stages is
analyzed using a theoretical performance model as well as measurements via
hardware counters. Machine independent optimization is compared to machine
specific optimization using BG/Q vector intrinsics. By using vector intrinsics
the main computations reach 1.2 PFlops on the entire machine Mira (12% of the
theoretical peak performance). The paper also presents scalability studies for
two idealized test cases that are relevant for NWP applications. The
atmospheric model NUMA delivers an excellent strong scaling efficiency of 99%
on the entire supercomputer Mira using a mesh with 1.8 billion grid points.
This allows to run a global forecast of a baroclinic wave test case at 3km
uniform horizontal resolution and double precision within the time frame

firmly on the notion of a private state, which is a powerful, uniquely quantum
method for simplifying the tripartite picture of privacy involving local
operations and public classical communication to a bipartite picture of quantum
privacy involving local operations and classical communication. This approach
has previously led to some of the strongest upper bounds on secret key rates,
including the squashed entanglement and the relative entropy of entanglement.
Here we use this approach along with a "privacy test" to establish a general
meta-converse bound for private communication, which has a number of
applications. The meta-converse allows for proving that any quantum channel's
relative entropy of entanglement is a strong converse rate for private
communication. For covariant channels, the meta-converse also leads to
second-order expansions of relative entropy of entanglement bounds for private
communication rates. For such channels, the bounds also apply to the private
communication setting in which the sender and receiver are assisted by
unlimited public classical communication, and as such, they are relevant for
establishing various converse bounds for quantum key distribution protocols
conducted over these channels. We find precise characterizations for several
channels of interest and apply the methods to establish several converse bounds
on the private transmission capabilities of all phase-insensitive bosonic

expensive to run, via the observation of the results of smaller computations.
We model this as an online learning problem with delayed feedback, where the
length of the delay is unbounded, which we study mainly in a stochastic
setting. We show that in this setting, consistency is not possible in general,
and that optimal forecasters might not have average regret going to zero.
However, it is still possible to give algorithms that converge asymptotically
to Bayes-optimal predictions, by evaluating forecasters on specific sparse
independent subsequences of their predictions. We give an algorithm that does
this, which converges asymptotically on good behavior, and give very weak
bounds on how long it takes to converge. We then relate our results back to the
problem of predicting large computations in a deterministic setting.

aspects of local geometric structure. We approach the problem of monocular
depth estimation by using a neural network to produce a mid-level
representation that summarizes these cues. This network is trained to
characterize local scene geometry by predicting, at every image location, depth
derivatives of different orders, orientations and scales. However, instead of a
single estimate for each derivative, the network outputs probability
distributions that allow it to express confidence about some coefficients, and
ambiguity about others. Scene depth is then estimated by harmonizing this
overcomplete set of network predictions, using a globalization procedure that
finds a single consistent depth map that best matches all the local derivative
distributions. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through evaluation
on the NYU v2 depth data set.

the influence widely into the network, is a core problem in multiple domains.
It finds applications in viral marketing, epidemic control, and assessing
cascading failures within complex systems. Despite the huge amount of effort,
IM in billion-scale networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and World Wide Web has
not been satisfactorily solved. Even the state-of-the-art methods such as TIM+
and IMM may take days on those networks.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose SSA and D-SSA, two novel sampling frameworks for
IM-based viral marketing problems. SSA and D-SSA are up to 1200 times faster
than the SIGMOD'15 best method, IMM, while providing the same
$(1-1/e-\epsilon)$ approximation guarantee. Underlying our frameworks is an
innovative Stop-and-Stare strategy in which they stop at exponential check
points to verify (stare) if there is adequate statistical evidence on the
solution quality. Theoretically, we prove that SSA and D-SSA are the first
approximation algorithms that use (asymptotically) minimum numbers of samples,
meeting strict theoretical thresholds characterized for IM. The absolute
superiority of SSA and D-SSA are confirmed through extensive experiments on
real network data for IM and another topic-aware viral marketing problem, named
TVM. The source code is available at https://github.com/hungnt55/Stop-and-Stare

Bayesian setting shows advantage in recovering under-sampled sparse signals
from corrupted observations. Compared to conventional convex optimization
methods, it has a much lower complexity and is computationally tractable. In
the GAMP framework, the sparse signal and the observation are viewed to be
generated according to some pre-specified probability distributions in the
input and output channels. However, the parameters of the distributions are
usually unknown in practice. In this paper, we propose an extended GAMP
algorithm with built-in parameter estimation (PE-GAMP) and present its
empirical convergence analysis. Specifically, PE-GAMP treats the parameters as
unknown random variables with simple priors and jointly estimates them with the
sparse signals. Sparse signal recovery experiments confirm PE-GAMP's
convergence behavior and show that its performance matches the oracle GAMP
algorithm that knows the true parameter values.

continuous-time Wiener process from an encoded version of its uniform samples
is considered. We first introduce a combined sampling and source coding problem
for the Wiener process under uniform sampling, and prove an associated source
coding theorem that characterizes the minimal distortion from samples. We then
derive a closed-form expression for this minimal distortion, given in terms of
a reverse waterfilling expression involving the asymptotic eigenvalue density
of a sequence of finite-rank operators. This expression allows to determine the
minimal distortion attainable for any prescribed sampling rate and number of
bits per time unit. In addition, it can be used to determine the ratio between
bitrate and sampling rate when the distortion due to sampling is of the same
magnitude as the distortion due to lossy compression. For example, we show that
using approximately $1$ bit per sample, the distortion is about $1.12$ times
that of the distortion-rate function of the Wiener process at the same bitrate.
We also derive an upper bound on the minimal distortion, that is obtained by a
sub-optimal compress-and-estimate remote source coding scheme. This bound
implies that as the sampling rate goes to infinity, compress-and-estimate is
sub-optimal up to a linear factor in the sampling interval.

representation. In order to address the first challenge, this paper recasts
facial attractiveness computation as a label distribution learning (LDL)
problem rather than a traditional single-label supervised learning task. In
this way, the negative influence of the label incomplete problem can be
reduced. Inspired by the recent promising work in face recognition using deep
neural networks to learn effective features, the second challenge is expected
to be solved from a deep learning point of view. A very deep residual network
is utilized to enable automatic learning of hierarchical aesthetics
representation. Integrating these two ideas, an end-to-end deep learning

unsupervised learning systems. The Mismatch Negativity (MMN) has also recently
been studied in relation to PC and found to be a useful ingredient in neural
predictive coding systems. Backed by the behavior of living organisms, such

invariant representations of the input world. However, most neural systems
still do not account for large number of synapses even though this has been
shown by a few machine learning researchers as an effective and very important
component of any neural system if such a system is to behave properly. Our
major point here is that PDC systems with the MMN effect in addition to a large
number of synapses can greatly improve any neural learning system's performance
and ability to make decisions in the machine world. In this paper, we propose a
novel bio-mimetic computational intelligence algorithm -- the Deviant Learning

This week, the first of 1500 researchers and support staff begin moving in from two major biomedical institutes. Collaborators will join them from three universities in London and a pharmaceutical company. But the United Kingdom's vote in June to leave the European Union has dampened some of the elation. Restrictions on migration could make it more difficult to recruit from overseas, and limited access to EU research funds could squeeze the operating budget. Some domestic observers worry that it will suck up so much talent and funding that universities outside London will suffer, but supporters say the Crick will strengthen science nationwide.

For years, researchers and drug developers have worried that standard preclinical tests for cardiac safety are actually too conservative, and may lead drugmakers to abandon promising and safe treatments early in development. Since 2013, an international team of regulators, academic researchers, and drug companies have been validating a more sophisticated set of tests, known as the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA). That painstaking process is inching toward completion. In the coming weeks, a key component of that assay, based on stem cellderived heart cells, will undergo blind testing on drugs with known risks at various academic and industry labs, and the CiPA collaborators hope to propose a new set of testing standards by the end of next year.

If successful, the suitbrought under the federal False Claims Act (FCA)could force Duke to return to the government up to three times the amount of any ill-gotten funds, and produce a multimillion-dollar payout to the whistleblower. The Duke case "should scare all [academic] institutions around the country," says attorney Joel Androphy of Berg &amp; Androphy in Houston, Texas, who specializes in false claims litigation. It appears to be one of the largest FCA suits ever to focus on research misconduct in academia, he says, and, if successful, could "open the floodgates" to other whistleblowing cases. Although relatively few FCA cases have targeted research universities, that's changing. And although recent court rulings suggest public universities may have some protection from FCA suits because they are government entities, private institutions do not. Eleven private universities, including Duke, are among the top 25 academic recipients of federal research dollars in recent years.

Lawmakers aren't likely to pare that list by much before they leave next month to campaign in advance of the 8 November elections. They might give some issues a second look after the election, however, when they return for a lame duck session. The one big responsibility Congress can't shirk is passing some kind of spending bill to keep the government running for the 2017 fiscal year, which begins on 1 October. Lawmakers are expected to put off a final decision by temporarily extending 2016 spending levels into 2017 with a so-called continuing resolution (CR). A CR means the budgets of federal research agencies will be frozen: Administrators won't be able to start new programs or benefit from the spending hikes envisioned in some preliminary appropriations bills awaiting final action. They include a hefty proposed increase for the National Institutes of Health, another big boost for a NASA mission to a jovian moon, a new Coast Guard icebreaker that would enhance polar research, and a third midsized research vessel for the U.S. academic fleet. A CR also would leave hanging major disagreements between the House of Representatives and the Senate on whether to continue U.S. participation in ITER, the costly international fusion project, and how much earth science NASA should carry out.

But the National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN), part of a 10-year, half-billion-dollar initiative launched in 2014 by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to enhance the diversity of the biomedical workforce, has gotten off to a rocky start. Even before it was publicly announced, divisions within the diversity community prompted NIH officials to take the unusual step of adding to its leadership team a scientist who had been part of a group that lost out in the competition to create the network. And earlier this year, the principal investigator for the multisite network resigned after continuing conflicts with NIH officials over the initiative's direction. NIH officials admit that 4 decades' worth of programs aimed at removing obstacles to participation by underrepresented groups haven't moved the needle very much. And NRMN's supporters are worried that NIH may also end the network prematurely if it falls short of some short-term, quantitative goals.

Now, researchers are trying to extend this cutting-edge treatment to people with solid tumors, like those spreading through the breasts, lungs, brain, and ovaries. Solid tumors are far more common than blood cancers and, if they metastasize, can be very difficult to treat. Doctors hope that the first wave of clinical trials will help chart a path toward success for a strategy that could upend cancer treatment as we know it. But the last few years have been humbling as well as exhilarating. To melt away solid tumors, T cell therapy must clear daunting hurdles it didn't face in blood cancers. So far there are glimmers of T cells' power, but nothing close to what blood cancer patients have experienced. Now, physicians are trying to figure out how to improve the odds of success while keeping risky side effects to a minimum.

Air pockets in feathers, furs, and woolen fabrics help reduce thermal conduction and keep warmth inside. Cooling, however, is much harder to achieve without the use of external active devices such as fans, air conditioners, or wearable thermoelectric coolers. The wicking technology used in modern athletic apparel to enhance convective cooling is not ideal for everyday clothes because it only works once perspiration begins. On page 1019 of this issue, Hsu et al. (1) report passive cooling of an object by a few Celsius degrees by simply allowing thermal radiation to pass efficiently through a nanoporous fabric. This demonstration may make possible wearable technologies for personalized cooling and paves the way for energy savings by reduced use of air conditioning.

Tumors occupy environments where they actively interact with multiple cellular processes, signaling pathways, and homeostatic mechanisms, such as, according to a recent study by Masri et al. (1), circadian rhythms. Tumor-secreted molecular messengers (the secretome) can spread over a range of distances and have both short-range and systemic influences on normal tissues and organs (2). To highlight the systemic effects of the cancer secretome, the concept of tumor macroenvironment has been coined (3). Masri et al. took this macro approach to inquire how tumors affect circadian cycling in a distal organ not yet infiltrated by metastasis.

Others have argued that the cold events merely reflect the chaotic variability of the climate system and are becoming less likely under climate change. How can different atmospheric scientists come to such different conclusions from the same data?

By showing that a set of transcription factors could reprogram somatic cells to acquire a pluripotent stem cell state, they ushered in the era of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The discovery made it crystal clear that cell identity is much more malleable than previously thought, and provided an invaluable tool for disease-oriented and translational researchers, bridging reductionism with patient-derived relevance. Combined with other maturing technologies, most notably genome editing and three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems, iPSC technology has enabled investigation that was hitherto only possible in model organisms (2, 3).

Governments debated how they would have responded had it happened on their home soil, aviation authorities reconsidered security, emergency services reassessed practices, and parents hugged their children tighter. Those of us in other countries willed Americans to rise above the senseless brutality and steadfastly defy the insult with patriotism, empathy, unity, and resilience. What we did not expect was the tawdry infighting, discord, and bitter dispute that would come to surround the identification and memorialization of those who lost their lives that day.

We present observations by the Dawn spacecraft that reveal a heavily cratered surface, a heterogeneous crater distribution, and an apparent absence of large craters. The morphology of some impact craters is consistent with ice in the subsurface, which might have favored relaxation, yet large unrelaxed craters are also present. Numerous craters exhibit polygonal shapes, terraces, flowlike features, slumping, smooth deposits, and bright spots. Crater morphology and simple-to-complex crater transition diameters indicate that the crust of Ceres is neither purely icy nor rocky. By dating a smooth region associated with the Kerwan crater, we determined absolute model ages (AMAs) of 550 million and 720 million years, depending on the applied chronology model.

The dwarf planet is dominated by numerous craters, but other features are also common. Linear structures include both those associated with impact craters and those that do not appear to have any correlation to an impact event. Abundant lobate flows are identified, and numerous domical features are found at a range of scales. Features suggestive of near-surface ice, cryomagmatism, and cryovolcanism have been identified. Although spectroscopic analysis has currently detected surface water ice at only one location on Ceres, the identification of these potentially ice-related features suggests that there may be at least some ice in localized regions in the crust.

In the cold outer solar system, volcanism can occur on solid bodies with a water-ice shell, but derived cryovolcanic constructs have proved elusive. We report the discovery, using Dawn Framing Camera images, of a landform on dwarf planet Ceres that we argue represents a viscous cryovolcanic dome. Parent material of the cryomagma is a mixture of secondary minerals, including salts and water ice. Absolute model ages from impact craters reveal that extrusion of the dome has occurred recently. Ceres evolution must have been able to sustain recent interior activity and associated surface expressions. We propose salts with low eutectic temperatures and thermal conductivities as key drivers for Ceres long-term internal evolution.

We used the spectrometer onboard the Dawn spacecraft to map their spatial distribution on the basis of diagnostic absorption features in the visible and near-infrared spectral range (0.25 to 5.0 micrometers). We found that magnesium- and ammonium-bearing minerals are ubiquitous across the surface. Variations in the strength of the absorption features are spatially correlated and indicate considerable variability in the relative abundance of the phyllosilicates, although their composition is fairly uniform. These data, along with the distinctive spectral properties of Ceres relative to other asteroids and carbonaceous meteorites, indicate that the phyllosilicates were formed endogenously by a globally widespread and extensive alteration process.

Theories predict a water ice-rich mantle, and water vapor emissions have been observed, yet no water (H2O) has been previously identified. The Visible and InfraRed (VIR) mapping spectrometer onboard the Dawn spacecraft has now detected water absorption features within a low-illumination, highly reflective zone in Oxo, a 10-kilometer, geologically fresh crater, on five occasions over a period of 1 month. Candidate materials are H2O ice and mineral hydrates. Exposed H2O ice would become optically undetectable within tens of years under current Ceres temperatures; consequently, only a relatively recent exposure or formation of H2O would explain Dawns findings. Some mineral hydrates are stable on geological time scales, but their formation would imply extended contact with ice or liquid H2O.

Parts of Ceres surface are heavily cratered, but the largest expected craters are absent. Ceres appears gravitationally relaxed at only the longest wavelengths, implying a mechanically strong lithosphere with a weaker deep interior. Ceres dry exterior displays hydroxylated silicates, including ammoniated clays of endogenous origin. The possibility of abundant volatiles at depth is supported by geomorphologic features such as flat crater floors with pits, lobate flows of materials, and a singular mountain that appears to be an extrusive cryovolcanic dome. On one occasion, Ceres temporarily interacted with the solar wind, producing a bow shock accelerating electrons to energies of tens of kilovolts.

Here we report an iridium oxide/strontium iridium oxide (IrOx/SrIrO3) catalyst formed during electrochemical testing by strontium leaching from surface layers of thin films of SrIrO3. This catalyst has demonstrated specific activity at 10 milliamps per square centimeter of oxide catalyst (OER current normalized to catalyst surface area), with only 270 to 290 millivolts of overpotential for 30 hours of continuous testing in acidic electrolyte. Density functional theory calculations suggest the formation of highly active surface layers during strontium leaching with IrO3 or anatase IrO2 motifs. The IrOx/SrIrO3 catalyst outperforms known IrOx and ruthenium oxide (RuOx) systems, the only other OER catalysts that have reasonable activity in acidic electrolyte.

Here, we report a copper-catalyzed radical relay pathway for enantioselective conversion of benzylic CH bonds into benzylic nitriles. Hydrogen-atom abstraction affords an achiral benzylic radical that undergoes asymmetric C(sp3)CN bond formation upon reaction with a chiral copper catalyst. The reactions proceed efficiently at room temperature with the benzylic substrate as limiting reagent, exhibit broad substrate scope with high enantioselectivity (typically 90 to 99% enantiomeric excess), and afford products that are key precursors to important bioactive molecules. Mechanistic studies provide evidence for diffusible organic radicals and highlight the difference between these reactions and CH oxidations mediated by enzymes and other catalysts that operate via radical rebound pathways.

We show that nanoporous polyethylene (nanoPE) is transparent to mid-infrared human body radiation but opaque to visible light because of the pore size distribution (50 to 1000 nanometers). We processed the material to develop a textile that promotes effective radiative cooling while still having sufficient air permeability, water-wicking rate, and mechanical strength for wearability. We developed a device to simulate skin temperature that shows temperatures 2.7 and 2.0C lower when covered with nanoPE cloth and with processed nanoPE cloth, respectively, than when covered with cotton. Our processed nanoPE is an effective and scalable textile for personal thermal management.

Here, we report the discovery of chiral acetyl-protected aminoethyl quinoline ligands that enable asymmetric palladium insertion into prochiral CH bonds on a single methylene carbon center. We apply these palladium complexes to catalytic enantioselective functionalization of -methylene CH bonds in aliphatic amides. Using bidentate ligands to accelerate CH activation of otherwise unreactive monodentate substrates is crucial for outcompeting the background reaction driven by substrate-directed cyclopalladation, thereby avoiding erosion of enantioselectivity. The potential of ligand acceleration in CH activation is also demonstrated by enantioselective -CH arylation of simple carboxylic acids without installing directing groups.

Cytokinins are mobile signals that are perceived by subsets of plant cells. We found that the responses to cytokinin signaling during Arabidopsis development are constrained by the transporter PURINE PERMEASE 14 (PUP14). In our experiments, the expression of PUP14 was inversely correlated to the cytokinin signaling readout. Loss of PUP14 function allowed ectopic cytokinin signaling accompanied by aberrant morphogenesis in embryos, roots, and the shoot apical meristem. PUP14 protein localized to the plasma membrane and imported bioactive cytokinins, thus depleting apoplastic cytokinin pools and inhibiting perception by plasma membranelocalized cytokinin sensors to create a sink for active ligands. We propose that the spatiotemporal cytokinin sink patterns established by PUP14 determine the cytokinin signaling landscape that shapes the morphogenesis of land plants.

The evolution of this capacity can be best investigated by comparative studies. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we explored whether and how dog brains segregate and integrate lexical and intonational information. We found a left-hemisphere bias for processing meaningful words, independently of intonation; a right auditory brain region for distinguishing intonationally marked and unmarked words; and increased activity in primary reward regions only when both lexical and intonational information were consistent with praise. Neural mechanisms to separately analyze and integrate word meaning and intonation in dogs suggest that this capacity can evolve in the absence of language.

We propose that this live attenuated vaccine acts like a silent natural infection in priming or boosting host immunity. A transmission dynamic model incorporating this hypothesis fits recent clinical trial data well and predicts that vaccine effectiveness depends strongly on the age group vaccinated and local transmission intensity. Vaccination in low-transmission settings may increase the incidence of more severe secondary-like infection and, thus, the numbers hospitalized for dengue. In moderate transmission settings, we predict positive impacts overall but increased risks of hospitalization with dengue disease for individuals who are vaccinated when seronegative. However, in high-transmission settings, vaccination benefits both the whole population and seronegative recipients. Our analysis can help inform policy-makers evaluating this and other candidate dengue vaccines.

We studied the local mechanisms that regulate the formation and distribution of synapses. We found that local -aminobutyric acid (GABA) release on dendrites of mouse cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons could induce gephyrin puncta and dendritic spine formation via GABA type A receptor activation and voltage-gated calcium channels during early postnatal development. Furthermore, the newly formed inhibitory and excitatory synaptic structures rapidly gained functions. Bidirectional manipulation of GABA release from somatostatin-positive interneurons increased and decreased the number of gephyrin puncta and dendritic spines, respectively. These results highlight a noncanonical function of GABA as a local synaptogenic element shaping the early establishment of neuronal circuitry in mouse cortex.

Here, we report on the two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectra of a semisynthetic KcsA channel with site-specific heavy (13C18O) isotope labels in the selectivity filter. The ultrafast time resolution of 2D IR spectroscopy provides an instantaneous snapshot of the multi-ion configurations and structural distributions that occur spontaneously in the filter. Two elongated features are resolved, revealing the statistical weighting of two structural conformations. The spectra are reproduced by molecular dynamics simulations of structures with water separating two K+ ions in the binding sites, ruling out configurations with ions occupying adjacent sites.

However, the site of antibody interception of virus and the mechanism of antibody-mediated protection remain unclear. We administered a fully protective dose of the bNAb PGT121 to rhesus monkeys and challenged them intravaginally with SHIV-SF162P3. In PGT121-treated animals, we detected low levels of viral RNA and viral DNA in distal tissues for seven days following challenge. Viral RNApositive tissues showed transcriptomic changes indicative of innate immune activation, and cells from these tissues initiated infection after adoptive transfer into nave hosts. These data demonstrate that bNAb-mediated protection against a mucosal virus challenge can involve clearance of infectious virus in distal tissues.

The ISS will be in 3-crew operations until the arrival of 48S on September 9, 2016. Human Research Program (HRP) Collections: Flight Engineer (FE)-6 assisted FE-5 with HRP operations in performing blood sample collections and configuring the Refrigerated Centrifuge for the first set of sample load operations. FE-5 performed urine sample collections and processed the blood samples by setting up Refrigerated Centrifuge for two sample spins. The urine and blood samples were stowed in the Minus Eighty-degree Freezer for ISS (MELFI). These sample collections will be used to support the HRP: Biochem Profile, Repository, and Cardio Ox investigations. Cardio Ox Ultrasound and Blood Pressure Operations: With remote guidance from the Cardio Ox ground teams, FE-5 assisted FE-6 in conducting an ultrasound scan after attaching the ECG Electrodes and marking the arteries followed by blood pressure measurements using the Cardiolab Holter Arterial Blood Pressure Unit. The goal of the Cardio Ox investigation is to determine whether biological markers of oxidative and inflammatory stress are elevated during and after space flight and whether this results in an increased, long-term risk of atherosclerosis risk in astronauts. Twelve crewmembers provide blood and urine samples to assess biomarkers before launch, 15 and 60 days after launch, 15 days before returning to Earth, and within days after landing. Ultrasound scans of the carotid and brachial arteries are obtained at the same time points, as well as through 5 years after landing, as an indicator of cardiovascular health. Marrow: FE-5 collected breath and ambient air samples in support of the Canadian Space Agencys Marrow experiment. Marrow investigation looks at the effect of microgravity on the bone marrow. It is believed that microgravity, like long-duration bed rest on Earth, has a negative effect on the bone marrow and the blood cells that are produced in the marrow. The extent of this effect, and its recovery, are of interest to space research and healthcare providers on Earth. Waste Hygiene Compartment (WHC) Piping Replacement: The crew replaced the WHC piping between the pump separator and the dose pump. This is routine preventative maintenance performed every 6 months. All activities were completed unless otherwise noted.

She also performed a thorough inspection of the walls and found no moisture. The crew also replaced all of the BEAM sensor extended life battery packs. The MAS and SSK samples as well as the RAM dosimeters will be packed for return on 46S and analyzed in Houston. Cardio Ox and Biochem Profile Collections: Rubins and FE-5 Onishi performed their Flight Day 60 (FD60) urine and blood collections and inserted them into Minus Eighty Degree Celsius Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI). The Biochemical Profile experiment tests blood and urine samples obtained from astronauts before, during, and after spaceflight. Specific proteins and chemicals in the samples are used as biomarkers, or indicators of health. Post-flight analysis yields a database of samples and test results, which scientists can use to study the effects of spaceflight on the body. The goal of Cardio Ox is to determine whether biological markers of oxidative and inflammatory stress are elevated during and after space flight and whether this results in an increased, long-term risk of atherosclerosis risk in astronauts. Marrow: Rubins collected breath and ambient air samples in support of the Canadian Space Agencys Marrow experiment. Marrow investigation looks at the effect of microgravity on the bone marrow.

The extent of this effect, and its recovery, are of interest to space research and healthcare providers on Earth. ISS Change of Command (COC): The entire crew discussed with Mission Control Center (MCC)-Houston and MCC-Moscow flight control teams their roles and responsibilities for the timeframe between the COC event and departure of 46S. Anatoly Ivanishin then assumed command of the ISS from Jeff Williams. Following the COC, the 47S crew became prime for emergency response. Post Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Tasks: The crew deconfigured the Airlock following last weeks EVA operations and prepared Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs) and equipment for long term stowage. They also performed EMU cooling loop maintenance on the EMUs used during the EVA (3003 and 3008). Crew Quarters (CQ) Port Cleaning: In preparation for his departure from the ISS tomorrow Williams cleaned his CQ, including the intake and exhaust ducts, fans and airflow sensors. All activities were completed unless otherwise noted.

They completed their post-EVA medical checkups, and performed an Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) Water Recharge procedure on EMUs 3003 and 3008. The EMUs and associated equipment were then be prepared for storage. They then participated in an EVA debrief to discuss any comments regarding preparation and execution of the EVA. Skin-B Operations: The Skin-B investigation was conducted as FE-6 performed Corneometer, Tewameter and Visioscan measurements on his forearm. The Corneometer measures the hydration level of the stratus coreum (outer layer of the skin), the Tewameter measures the skin barrier function, and the Visioscan measures the skin surface topography. Skin B is a European Space Agency (ESA) investigation that aims to improve the understanding of skin aging, which is greatly accelerated in space. The data will also be used to verify the results from previous testing for the SkinCare investigation on the ISS. Space Headaches: The crew completed the ESA Space Headaches questionnaire which provides information that may help in the development of methods to alleviate associated symptoms and improvement in the well-being and performance of crew members in space. Headaches during space flight can negatively affect mental and physical capacities of crew members which can influence performance during a space mission. Habitability Walk-through: The crew recorded a walk-through video documenting observations of life onboard ISS, providing insight related to human factors and habitability. The Habitability investigation collects observations about the relationship between crew members and their environment on the ISS. Observations can help spacecraft designers understand how much habitable volume is required, and whether a missions duration impacts how much space crew members need.

This afternoon the crew performed a conference with EVA ground specialist to discuss any final question about tomorrows TTCR EVA. The crew also prepared the Equipment Lock, EMUs and ancillary hardware to support EVA prep activities. Crew egress of the Airlock is scheduled for 7:10 am CDT. Multi-Omics sample collections: Flight Engineer-5 collected samples for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Multi-Omics experiment. Samples were then placed into the Minus Eighty Degree Celsius Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI). The Multi-omics analysis of human microbial-metabolic cross-talk in the space ecosystem (Multi-Omics) investigation evaluates the impacts of space environment and prebiotics on astronauts immune function, by combining the data obtained from the measurements of changes in the gut microbiological composition, metabolites profiles, and the immune system. Biomarkers for immune dysfunction during the crewmembers time on the ISS could be useful for the health management of astronauts. Habitability walkthrough: The Commander performed his sixth and final Habitability walkthrough video. Williams has been requested to focus on the windows available to the crew on the ISS, and their impact on habitability and productivity. The Habitability investigation results will be used to assess the relationship between crew members and their environment in order to better prepare for future long-duration spaceflights. Observations recorded during 6 month and 1 year missions can help spacecraft designers determine how much habitable volume is required, and whether a missions duration impacts how much space crew members need. Fine Motor Skills (FMS): Flight Engineer-5 completed his 9th of 20 sessions of FMS. Performing a series of interactive tasks on a touchscreen tablet were completed for the Fine Motor Skills investigation. This investigation is critical during long-duration space missions, particularly those skills needed to interact with technologies required in next-generation space vehicles, spacesuits, and habitats. The crewmembers fine motor skills are also necessary for performing tasks in transit or on a planetary surface, such as information access, just-in-time training, subsystem maintenance, and medical treatment. Circadian Rhythms: After 36 hours of wear-time, Flight Engineer-5 doffed the Double Sensors and Thermolab Control Unit and stowed the equipment. The objective of the experiment is to get a better understanding of any alterations in circadian rhythms in humans during long-term space flights. Such knowledge will not only provide important insights into the adaptations of the human autonomic nervous system in space over time, but also has significant practical implications by helping to improve physical exercise, rest- and work shifts as well as fostering adequate workplace illumination in the sense of occupational healthcare in future space missions.

The goal of the Cardio Ox investigation is to determine whether biological markers of oxidative and inflammatory stress are elevated during and after space flight and whether this results in an increased, long-term risk of atherosclerosis risk in astronauts. Twelve crewmembers provide blood and urine samples to assess biomarkers before launch, 15 and 60 days after launch, 15 days before returning to Earth, and within days after landing. Ultrasound scans of the carotid and brachial arteries are obtained at the same time points, as well as through 5 years after landing, as an indicator of cardiovascular health. Dose Tracker: The crew completed entries for medication tracking on an iPad today. This investigation documents the medication usage of crewmembers before and during their missions by capturing data regarding medication use during spaceflight, including side effect qualities, frequencies and severities. The data is expected to either support or counter anecdotal evidence of medication ineffectiveness during flight and unusual side effects experienced during flight. It is also expected that specific, near-real-time questioning about symptom relief and side effects will provide the data required to establish whether spaceflight-associated alterations in pharmacokinetics (PK) or pharmacodynamics (PD) is occurring during missions. Fine Motor Skills: A series of interactive tasks were completed for the Fine Motor Skills investigation. This investigation is critical during long-duration space missions, particularly those skills needed to interact with technologies required in next-generation space vehicles, spacesuits, and habitats. The crewmembers fine motor skills are also necessary for performing tasks in transit or on a planetary surface, such as information access, just-in-time training, subsystem maintenance, and medical treatment. Habitability Human Factors Directed Observations: The crew recorded and submitted a walk-through video documenting observations of life onboard ISS, providing insight related to human factors and habitability. The Habitability investigation collects observations about the relationship between crew members and their environment on the ISS. Observations can help spacecraft designers understand how much habitable volume is required, and whether a missions duration impacts how much space crew members need. Trailing Thermal Control Radiator (TTCR) Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparations: The EV crew continued the EVA tool configuration in preparation for the TTCR EVA on Thursday. The IV crew accessed the Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics (DOUG) software and completed additional robotics reviews of Space Station Remote Manipulator System support plan for the EVA. External Television Camera Group (ETVCG) Troubleshooting: The crew performed a procedure to verify that the heaters on the spare ETVCG Light are functional. They utilized the two jumpers that were built from pin kit materials and tested the ETVCG light and heaters. After the troubleshooting, the crew confirmed a functional camera light and heater circuit on the ETVCG. This light will be used to replace the degraded light at the P1 Lower Outboard location during Thursdays TTCR EVA. Todays Planned Activities All activities completed unless otherwise noted.

The Biomolecule Sequencer investigation seeks to demonstrate for the first time that DNA sequencing is feasible in an orbiting spacecraft. A space-based DNA sequencer could identify microbes, diagnose diseases and understand crew member health, and potentially help detect DNA-based life elsewhere in the solar system. Marrow Blood, Breath, and Ambient Air Sample Collection: Over the weekend the crew set up the Marrow air sample collection hardware in the crew quarters and today upon waking the crew took breath and ambient air samples to measure carbon monoxide concentration for the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) Marrow experiment. Marrow investigates the effect of microgravity on human bone marrow. It is believed that microgravity, like long-duration bed rest on Earth, has a negative effect on bone marrow and the blood cells that are produced in the marrow. The extent of this effect and its recovery are of interest to space research and healthcare providers on Earth. Human Research Program (HRP) Generic Urine and Frozen Blood Collection Double Spin: The crew continued HRP operations that began over the weekend by collecting saliva and urine samples for 24-hours and processing a set of blood samples for double spin operations using the Refrigerated Centrifuge. The samples were stowed in the Minus Eighty-degree Freezer for ISS MELFI. Mouse Epigenetics Closeout and Reconfiguration Operations: The crew performed Mouse Epigenetics closeout and reconfiguration activities to clean up and disassemble the Glove Box before removing the Mouse Habitat Cage Unit from the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF). The crew also changed the CBEF video output cable configuration from multiple channel cable to single channel cable and disconnect the CBEF Multiple Video Cable between CBEF and Image Processing Unit (IPU) as well as the CBEF and Video compression and Recording Unit 2 (VRU2) on Multi-purpose Small PayloadRack2 (MSPR2). Thermolab Instrumentation for Circadian Rhythms: The crew began the first of a three-day European Space Agency (ESA) Circadian Rhythms experiment by performing instrumentation with the Thermolab Double sensors, mounting the Thermolab Unit in the belt, connecting and powering on the Thermolab Unit before beginning a 36 hour continuous measurement. After the measurement was completed, the data was transferred and hardware stowed. The objective of the experiment is to get a better understanding of alterations in circadian rhythms in humans during long-term space flights. Such knowledge will not only provide important insights into the adaptations of the human autonomic nervous system in space over time, but also has significant practical implications by helping to improve physical exercise, rest and work shifts as well as fostering adequate workplace illumination in the sense of occupational healthcare in future space missions. Multi-Omics Operations: Today the crew supported the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Multi-Omics investigation by collecting body samples and inserting them into a Box Module in the Minus Eighty-degree Freezer for ISS (MELFI). The investigation evaluates the impacts of space environment and prebiotics on astronauts immune function by combining the data obtained from the measurements of changes in the microbiological composition, metabolites profiles, and the immune system. Habitability Human Factors Directed Observations: The crew will recorded and submited a walk-through video documenting observations of life onboard ISS, providing insight related to human factors and habitability. The Habitability investigation collects observations about the relationship between crew members and their environment on the ISS. Observations can help spacecraft designers understand how much habitable volume is required and whether a missions duration impacts how much space crew members need. Trailing Thermal Control Radiator (TTCR) Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparations: The Extravehicular (EV) crew conducted a review of procedures that cover the suit donning plan, pre-breathe protocol, Equipment Lock activities, egress and detailed EVA timeline. Following the review they participated in a conference with ground teams. The Intravehicular (IV) crew accessed the Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics (DOUG) software and completed a robotics review of Space Station Remote Manipulator System support plan for US EVA #37 this Thursday. External Television Camera Group (ETVCG) Troubleshooting Test Lead Build: The crew performed part 1 of a procedure to verify the heaters on the spare ETVCG Light are functional. They built two jumpers from pin kit materials for use in tomorrow&#8217;s task. Remote Power Control Module (RPCM) Remove &#38; Replace (R&#38;R): Over the weekend, Robotics Ground Controllers unstowed the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) from Mobile Base System (MBS) Power Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF)2. At the end of re-rigidizing the SPDM Latching End Effector (LEE) for SPDM unstow, the SPDM safed, which has been observed previously. Controllers performed the necessary recovery steps and released the SPDM LEE from MBS PDGF2. Once the SPDM had been unstowed, controllers maneuvered the SSRMS and SPDM to position SPDM Arm2 to use Robot Micro Conical Tool #2 (RMCT2) to demate and remove RPCM P12B_A from its slot which was previously attempted on June 14, 2016 without success. Today, after numerous pull and wiggle attempts, the RPCM came out of its slot. Both the RPCM and its slot were inspected and nothing was seen that would preclude pressing with stowing the RPCM in a spare slot and installing another RPCM in Slot P12B_A. This RPCM was then stowed in Spare Slot P13A_H. Controllers commanded the SPDM Arm 2 On-Orbit Replaceable Unit (ORU) Tool Change-out Mechanism (OTCM) handling the RMCT2 to release the Failed RPCM (removed from P12B_A slot) in the P13A_H slot. They then maneuvered the SSRMS and SPDM to position SPDM Arm2 to align RMCT2 with the spare RPCM located in P11A_D to demate and remove it from its slot. This RPCM was then moved to the P12B_A slot. It was successfully inserted and bolted to P12B_A worksite after being pushed with the maximum force allowed of 200 N. SPDM Arm 2 released the spare RPCM in P12B_A and ground teams confirmed it was functioning nominally. 46 Soyuz Survey: Following the RPCM R&#38;R, [&#8230;]</p></details></div><div><details><summary class='inner'><a href='https://blogs.nasa.gov/stationreport/2016/08/26/iss-daily-summary-report-08262016/' target='_blank'>ISS Daily Summary Report  08/26/2016</a></summary><p>SpaceX (SpX)-9 Release: Following the unberth of Dragon yesterday afternoon, the crew used the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) to release Dragon at 5:11 AM Central Time for its return to Earth. The Dragon capsule executed a de-orbit burn shortly after 10 AM Central Time, and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean approximately 45 minutes later. SpaceX-9 returned cargo and science samples which were processed onboard the ISS for analysis on the ground. Biological Rhythms 48 Holter and Actiwatch Removal and Data Save: Following two consecutive days of Biological Rhythms recording sessions, the crew removed the Digital Walk Holter Electrocardiogram (ECG) and the Actiwatch Spectrum and saved the collected data to the medical laptop. This concluded the Biological Rhythms experiment where two separate 24-hour Actiwatch measurements were performed to study the effects of long-term microgravity exposure on heart functions by analyzing an astronauts electrocardiogram for 48 hours. Biomolecule Sequencer Hardware Setup and Sample Initialization: The crew retrieved the Flow Cell and the Media Syringe Tube from Minus Eighty-degree Freezer for ISS (MELFI) before using the syringe to inject the sample into the Biomolecule Sequencer, which began the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing process. The Biomolecule Sequencer investigation seeks to demonstrate for the first time that DNA sequencing is feasible in an orbiting spacecraft. A space-based DNA sequencer could identify microbes, diagnose diseases and understand crew member health, and potentially help detect DNA-based life elsewhere in the solar system. Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) Manifold Bottle Replacement: The crew R&#38;Rd a CIR manifold bottle on one of the four CIR Manifolds in support of upcoming Flex 2 payload investigation activities. Fine Motor Skills: A series of interactive tasks on a touchscreen tablet were completed for the Fine Motor Skills investigation. This investigation is critical during long-duration space missions, particularly those skills needed to interact with technologies required in next-generation space vehicles, spacesuits, and habitats. The crewmembers fine motor skills are also necessary for performing tasks in transit or on a planetary surface, such as information access, just-in-time training, subsystem maintenance, and medical treatment. Space Headaches: The crew completed the European Space Agency (ESA) Space Headaches questionnaire which provides information that may help in the development of methods to alleviate associated symptoms and improvement in the well-being and performance of crew members in space. LS-1 Server Issues: Following the recent issues with the LS-1 server, the crew performed a laptop shell swap (motherboard, processor, memory) and retained only the hard drives. The LS-1 came back online without any issues. LAB RWS Monitor Display Issue: Prior to Dragon release, the SSRMS Lab Robotic Work Station (RWS) Monitor 1 was observed to be very dim, with the image shifted, and it seemed to be a negative image. The crew tried the brightness adjustment and checked the cables with no success. The video feed was moved from the degraded display Monitor 1 to a Monitor 3 which was operating nominally. The release and departure monitoring were completed nominally and on time. The LAB RWS Monitor 1 was later recovered by power cycling the Control Electronic Unit (CEU). The root cause is still under investigation. Todays Planned Activities All activities were completed unless otherwise noted. MORZE.
