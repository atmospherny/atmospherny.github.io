characterizing the molecular environment. We observed the CO(3-2),
^{13}CO(3-2), C^{18}O(3-2), HCO+(3-2), and HCN(3-2) molecular lines in a region
of 150" x 150", centered on the IRAS source, to analyze the distribution and
characteristics of the molecular gas linked to the IRAS source. The molecular
gas distribution reveals a molecular clump that is coincident with IRAS
08589-4714 and with a dust clump detected at 1.2 mm. The molecular clump is
0.45 pc in radius and its mass and H_2 volume density are 310 Mo and 1.2 x 10^4
cm^{-3}, respectively. Two overdensities were identified within the clump in
HCN and HCO lines. A comparison of the LTE and virial masses suggests that the
clump is collapsing in regions that harbor young stellar objects. An analysis
of the molecular lines suggests that they are driving molecular outflows.

stellar streams to detect low-mass dark matter subhaloes. In smooth and static
host potentials, tidal tails of disrupting satellites appear highly symmetric.
However, dark perturbers induce density fluctuations that destroy this
symmetry. Motivated by the recent release of unprecedentedly deep and wide
imaging data around the Pal 5 stellar stream, we develop a new probabilistic,
adaptive and non-parametric technique which allows us to bring the cluster's
tidal tails into clear focus. Strikingly, we uncover a stream whose density
exhibits visible changes on a variety of angular scales. We detect significant
bumps and dips, both narrow and broad: two peaks on either side of the
progenitor, each only a fraction of a degree across, and two gaps,
$\sim2^{\circ}$ and $\sim9^{\circ}$ wide, the latter accompanied by a
gargantuan lump of debris. This largest density feature results in a pronounced
inter-tail asymmetry which cannot be made consistent with an unperturbed stream
according to a suite of simulations we have produced. We conjecture that the
sharp peaks around Pal 5 are epicyclic overdensities, while the two dips are
consistent with impacts by subhaloes. Assuming an age of 3.4 Gyr for Pal 5,
these two gaps would correspond to the characteristic size of gaps created by
subhaloes in the mass range of $10^6-10^7 M_\odot$ and $10^7-10^8 M_\odot$
respectively. In addition to dark substructure, we find that the bar of the
Milky Way can plausibly produce the asymmetric density seen in Pal 5 and that
GMCs could cause the smaller gap.

disappearance of the failed supernova candidate identified by Gerke et al.
(2015). This $\sim 25~M_{\odot}$ red supergiant experienced a weak $\sim
10^{6}~L_{\odot}$ optical outburst in 2009 and is now at least 5 magnitudes
fainter than the progenitor in the optical. The mid-IR flux has slowly
decreased to the lowest levels since the first measurements in 2004. There is
faint ($2000-3000~L_{\odot}$) near-IR emission likely associated with the
source. We find the late-time evolution of the source to be inconsistent with
obscuration from an ejected, dusty shell. Models of the spectral energy
distribution indicate that the remaining bolometric luminosity is $&gt;6$ times
fainter than that of the progenitor and is decreasing as $\sim t^{-4/3}$. We
conclude that the transient is unlikely to be a SN impostor or stellar merger.
The event is consistent with the ejection of the envelope of a red supergiant
in a failed supernova and the late-time emission could be powered by fallback
accretion onto a newly-formed black hole. Future IR and X-ray observations are
needed to confirm this interpretation of the fate for the star.

results of (Achitouv et al. 2016) for the void profiles and their deviation

the large scale structures such as the abundance of voids or overdense
environments. We also introduce a new way to identify voids in the cosmic web,
using only a few measurements of the density fluctuations around random
positions. This algorithm allows to select voids with specific profiles and
radii. As a consequence, we can target classes of voids with higher differences
between f(R) and standard gravity void profiles. Finally we apply our void
criteria to galaxy mock catalogues and discuss how the flexibility of our void

from the coalescence of two neutron stars or black holes---carry not only
information about the corresponding spacetime but also about the underlying
theory of gravity. Although general relativity remains the simplest, most
elegant and viable theory of gravitation, there are generic and robust
arguments indicating that it is not the ultimate description of the
gravitational universe. Here we focus on a particularly appealing extension of
general relativity, which corrects Einstein's theory through the addition of
terms which are second order in curvature: the topological Gauss-Bonnet
invariant coupled to a dilaton. We study gravitational-wave emission from black
holes in this theory, and (i) find strong evidence that black holes are
linearly (mode) stable against both axial and polar perturbations; (ii) discuss
how the quasinormal modes of black holes can be excited during collisions
involving black holes, and finally (iii) show that future ringdown detections
with large signal-to-noise ratio would improve current constraints on the
coupling parameter of the theory.

by the decays of singlet scalars. All previous studies applied simplifying
assumptions and/or studied the process only on the level of number densities,
which makes it impossible to give statements about cosmic structure formation.
We overcome these issues by dropping all simplifying assumptions (except for
one we showed earlier to work perfectly) and by computing the full course of
Dark Matter production on the level of non-thermal momentum distribution
functions. We are thus in the position to study all aspects of the resulting
settings and apply all relevant bounds in a reliable manner. We have a
particular focus on how to incorporate bounds from structure formation on the
level of the linear power spectrum, since the simplistic estimate using the
free-streaming horizon clearly fails for highly non-thermal distributions. Our
work comprises the most detailed and comprehensive study of sterile neutrino
Dark Matter production by scalar decays presented so far.

in optical Seyfert 1 galaxies (NGC 7469, I Zw 1, and IC 4329 A) and eleven
luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) with various levels of infrared estimated
energetic contributions by AGNs at the HCN and HCO+ J=3-2 emission lines. The
HCN and HCO+ J=3-2 emission lines are clearly detected at the main nuclei of
all sources, except for IC 4329 A. The vibrationally excited (v2=1f) HCN J=3-2
and HCO+ J=3-2 emission lines are simultaneously covered, and HCN v2=1f J=3-2
emission line signatures are seen in the main nuclei of two LIRGs, IRAS
12112+0305 and IRAS 22491-1808, neither of which show clear buried AGN
signatures in the infrared. If the vibrational excitation is dominated by
infrared radiative pumping, through the absorption of infrared 14 um photons,
primarily originating from AGN-heated hot dust emission, then these two LIRGs
may contain infrared-elusive, but (sub)millimeter-detectable, extremely deeply
buried AGNs. These vibrationally excited emission lines are not detected in the
three AGN-dominated optical Seyfert 1 nuclei. However, the observed HCN v2=1f

intrinsic flux ratios in LIRGs with detectable HCN v2=1f emission lines. The
observed HCN-to-HCO+ J=3-2 flux ratios tend to be higher in galactic nuclei
with luminous AGN signatures compared with starburst-dominated regions, as
previously seen at J=1-0 and J=4-3.

hole X-ray binary V404 Cyg obtained during its summer 2015 ourburst. This work
primarily focuses on observations coinciding with the height of this outburst
activity. The $NuSTAR$ data show extreme variability in both the flux and
spectral properties of the source. These variations are driven in part by
strong and variable line-of-sight absorption, similar to previous outbursts
from this source. The latter stages of this observation are dominated by strong
flares, reaching luminosities close to Eddington in the $NuSTAR$ bandpass.
During these flares, the central source appears to be relatively unobscured,
and the data show clear evidence for a strong contributon from relativistic
reflection, which provides a means to probe the geometry of the innermost
accretion flow. Based on the combination of the flare properties, analogy with
other Galactic black hole binaries, and also the simultaneous onset of radio
activity with the period of intense X-ray flaring, we argue that these flares
represent transient jet ejections during which the ejected plasma is the
primary source of illumination for the accretion disk. If this is the case,
then our modeling of the relativistic reflection implies that these jets are
launched in close proximity to the black hole (as close as a few gravitational
radii), consistent with expectations for jet launching models that tap either
the spin of the central black hole, or the very innermost accretion disk. Our
reflection analysis also allows us to place the first constraints on the black
hole spin for this source, which we find to be $a^* &gt; 0.98$ (90% statistical
uncertainty).

interpreted as evidence for an X-shaped structure. We have recently suggested,
however, an alternative interpretation based on the multiple population
phenomenon, where the bright RC is from helium enhanced second-generation stars
(G2), while the faint RC is representing first-generation stars (G1) with
normal helium abundance. Here our RC models are constructed in a large
parameter space to see the effects of metallicity, age, and helium abundance on
the double RC feature. Our models show that the luminosity of RC stars is
mainly affected by helium abundance, while the RC color is primarily affected
by metallicity. The effect of age is relatively small, unless it is older than
12 Gyr or much younger than 6 Gyr. The observed double RC feature can therefore
be reproduced in a relatively large parameter space, once {\Delta}Y between G2
and G1 is assumed to be greater than $\sim$0.10. We further show that the
longitude dependence of the double RC feature at $b \approx -8.5 \deg$, which
was pointed out by Gonzalez et al. (2015) as a potential problem of our model,
is well explained in our scenario by a classical bulge embedded in a tilted
bar.

refinement (AMR) simulations of isolated dwarf and L-star disk galaxies with
20-40 pc resolution. The models are thermal dump, stochastic thermal,
'mechanical' (injecting energy or momentum depending on the resolution),
kinetic, and delayed cooling feedback. We focus on the ability of each model to
suppress star formation and generate outflows. Our highest-resolution runs
marginally resolve the adiabatic phase of the feedback events, which correspond
to 40 SN explosions, and the first three models yield nearly identical results,
possibly indicating that kinetic and delayed cooling feedback converge to wrong
results. At lower resolution all models differ, with thermal dump feedback
becoming inefficient. Thermal dump, stochastic, and mechanical feedback
generate multiphase outflows with mass loading factors $\beta \ll 1$, which is
much lower than observed. For the case of stochastic feedback we compare to
published SPH simulations, and find much lower outflow rates. Kinetic feedback
yields fast, hot outflows with $\beta\sim 1$, but only if the wind is in effect
hydrodynamically decoupled from the disk by using a large bubble radius.
Delayed cooling generates cold, dense and slow winds with $\beta&gt; 1$, but large
amounts of gas occupy regions of temperature-density space with short cooling
times. We conclude that either our resolution is too low to warrant physically
motivated models for SN feedback, that feedback mechanisms other than SNe are
important, or that other aspects of galaxy evolution, such as star formation,
require better treatment.

observed in the first year of MaNGA. The galaxies are selected with $M_{r} &gt;
-19.1$, stellar masses $10^{9}$ M$_{\odot} &lt; M_{\star} &lt; 5\times10^{9}$
M$_{\odot}$, EW$_{H\alpha} &lt;2$ \AA, and all have red colours $(u-r)&gt;1.9$. They
lie on the size-magnitude and $\sigma$-luminosity relations for previously
studied dwarf galaxies. Just six ($15\pm5.7$ per cent) are found to have
rotation speeds $v_{e,rot} &lt; 15$ km s$^{-1}$ at $\sim1$ $R_{e}$, and may be
dominated by pressure support at all radii. Two galaxies in our sample have
kinematically distinct cores in their stellar component, likely the result of
accretion. Six contain ionised gas despite not hosting ongoing star formation,
and this gas is typically kinematically misaligned from their stellar
component. This is the first large-scale Integral Field Unit (IFU) study of low
mass galaxies selected without bias against low-density environments.
Nevertheless, we find the majority of these galaxies are within $\sim1.5$ Mpc
of a bright neighbour ($M_{K} &lt; -23$; or M$_{\star} &gt; 5\times10^{10}$
M$_{\odot}$), supporting the hypothesis that galaxy-galaxy or galaxy-group
interactions quench star formation in low-mass galaxies. The local bright
galaxy density for our sample is $\rho_{proj} = 8.2\pm2.0$ Mpc$^{-2}$, compared
to $\rho_{proj} = 2.1\pm0.4$ Mpc$^{-2}$ for a star forming comparison sample,
confirming that the quenched low mass galaxies are preferentially found in
higher density environments.

their gas density and temperature profiles may be predicted in detail. Gas in
RELHICs is nearly fully ionized but with neutral cores that span a large range

We present predictions for their characteristic sizes and central column

late evolutionary stages (or for fractions of assembled mass larger than ~
80%), the innermost regions formed stars on average earlier than the outermost
ones (inside-out). At earlier epochs, when the age resolution of the method
becomes poor, the mass assembly seems to be spatially homogeneous or even in
the outside-in mode, specially for the red/quiescent/early-type galaxies. The
innermost MGHs are in general more regular (less scatter around the mean) than
the outermost ones. For dwarf and low-mass galaxies, we do not find evidence of
an outside-in formation mode; instead their radial MGHs are very diverse most
of the time, with periods of outside- in and inside-out modes (or strong radial
migration), suggesting this an episodic SF history. Blue/star-forming/late-type
galaxies present on average a significantly more pronounced inside-out
formation mode than red/quiescent/early-type galaxies, independently of mass.
We discuss our results in the light of the processes of galaxy formation,

out to observations of the earliest "first-light" structures in the Universe.
It will also study the distribution of the dark and ordinary matter at all

of the axisymmetric gravitational potential of the disk, accounts for &gt;30% of
this overall increase in disk-plane density. This is significantly larger that
of previously claimed deviations from the standard halo model. The dark-matter
density and kinematic wakes driven by the Milky Way bar increase the
detectability of dark matter overall, especially for the experiments with
higher $v_{min}$. These astrophysical features increase the detection rate by
more than a factor of two when compared to the standard halo model and by a
factor of ten for experiments with high minimum recoil energy thresholds. These
same features increase (decrease) the annual modulation for low (high) minimum
recoil energy experiments. We present physical arguments for why these dynamics
are generic for barred galaxies such as the Milky Way rather than contingent on
a specific galaxy model.

From this saturated value, we constrain the electron energy injection spectral
index, $\gamma$, and the fractional contribution of supernova remnants to the
total radio flux. Our results indicate relatively low $\gamma \sim 1.8-1.9$ and
a large supernova remnants contribution ($\sim 15-25\%$). For very compact

Kepler} telescope as part of {\it K2} Campaign 6. The photometric time series
has one-minute time sampling and a precision of about 690~ppm, after filtering
out artifacts and spurious trends. We identify dozens of starspot-crossing
events, when the planet eclipsed a relatively dark region of the stellar
photosphere. The observed patterns in the sequence of these events demonstrate
that the planet always transits over the same range of stellar latitudes, and
therefore that the stellar obliquity is less than about 10$^\circ$. We support
this conclusion with two different modeling approaches: one based on explicit
identification and timing of the events, and the other based on fitting the
light curves with a spotted-star model. We are also able to refine the usual
transit parameters and measure the stellar rotation period ($18.5 \pm
1.9$~days), corresponding to a 'gyrochronological' age of $1.4 \pm 0.3$ Gyr.
Coherent flux variations with the same period as the transits are seen
throughout the entire light curve. These variations are well modeled as the
combined effects of ellipsoidal light variations ($17.4 \pm 2.8$~ppm) and
Doppler boosting ($11.9 \pm 2.5$~ppm). The magnitudes of these effects are both
consistent with a planetary mass of $2.6 \pm 0.5~ M_{\text{Jup}}$, which is in
turn consistent with the mass determined by the Doppler technique. No
occultations are detected, giving a 2$\sigma$ upper limit of $0.013$ on the
planet's visual geometric albedo. The measured transit times are consistent
with a constant orbital period. In particular we find no evidence for orbital
decay, although we are only able to place a weak lower bound on the relevant
tidal quality factor: $Q'_\star &gt; 1.5\times 10^4$~(95\% confidence).

around rotating boson stars and Kerr black holes with scalar hair can exhibit
chaotic patterns. Since no separation of variables is known (or expected) for
geodesic motion on these backgrounds, we examine the 2D effective potentials
for photon trajectories, to obtain a deeper understanding of this phenomenon.
We find that the emergence of stable light rings on the background spacetimes,
allows the formation of "pockets" in one of the effective potentials, for open
sets of impact parameters, leading to an effective trapping of some
trajectories, dubbed quasi-bound orbits. We conclude that pocket formation
induces chaotic scattering, although not all chaotic orbits are associated to
pockets. These and other features are illustrated in a gallery of examples,
obtained with a new ray-tracing code, PYHOLE, which includes tools for a
simple, simultaneous visualization of the effective potential together with the
spacetime trajectory, for any given point in a lensing image. An analysis of
photon orbits allows us to further establish a positive correlation between
photon orbits in chaotic regions and those with more than one turning point in
the radial direction; we recall that the latter is not possible around Kerr
black holes. Moreover, we observe that the existence of several light rings
around a horizon (several fundamental orbits, including a stable one), is a
central ingredient for the existence of multiple shadows of a single hairy
black hole. We also exhibit the lensing and shadows by Kerr black holes with
scalar hair, observed away from the equatorial plane, obtained with PYHOLE.

accurately describes the full quantum theory when the occupancy numbers of
systems are very large. However, the situation is less understood in
interacting theories, especially on time scales longer than the dynamical
relaxation time. Recently there have been claims that the quantum theory
deviates spectacularly from the classical theory on this time scale, even if
the occupancy numbers are extremely large. Furthermore, it is claimed that the
quantum theory quickly thermalizes while the classical theory does not. The
evidence for these claims comes from noticing a spectacular difference in the
time evolution of expectation values of quantum operators compared to the
classical micro-state evolution. If true, this would have dramatic consequences
for many important phenomena, including laboratory studies of interacting BECs,
dark matter axions, preheating after inflation, etc. In this work we critically
examine these claims. We show that in fact the classical theory can describe
the quantum behavior in the high occupancy regime, even when interactions are
large. The connection is that the expectation values of quantum operators in a
single quantum micro-state are approximated by the corresponding classical
ensemble average over many classical micro-states. Furthermore, by the ergodic
theorem, the classical ensemble average of local fields with statistical
translation invariance is the spatial average of a single micro-state. So the
correlation functions of the quantum and classical field theories of a single
micro-state approximately agree at high occupancy, even in interacting systems.
Furthermore, both quantum and classical field theories can thermalize, when
appropriate coarse graining is introduced, with the classical case requiring a
cutoff on low occupancy UV modes. We discuss applications of our results.

with each other and with a wind component, most likely the periodic fast wind
emanating from the central binary system. We find that a cylindrical shell with
a lower velocity polar structure gives the best model fit to the spectroscopy

of low velocity. The individual knots have irregular tail shapes; we propose
here that they emanate from episodic winds from ongoing dwarf nova outbursts by
the central system. The nova shell is cylindrical and the symmetry axis relates
to the inclination of the central binary system. Furthermore, the cylinder axis
is aligned with the long axis of the bipolar planetary nebula in which it is
embedded. Thus, the central binary system is responsible for the bipolarity of
the planetary nebula and the cylindrical nova shell. The gradual planetary
nebula ejecta versus sudden nova ejecta is the reason for the different degrees
of bipolarity. We propose that the 'jet' feature is an illuminated lobe of the

three CMEs by combining simultaneous data acquired in the polarized visible

primarily aimed at testing the diagnostic methods that will be applied to
coronagraphic observations of CMEs delivered by the Metis instrument on board

logN(HI)(cm^-2)=20.8+/-0.1. The DLA has super-Solar metallicity with a
depletion pattern typical of cold gas and an overall molecular fraction ~50%.
This is the highest f-value observed to date in a high-z intervening system.
Most of the molecular hydrogen arises from a clearly identified narrow (b~0.7
km/s), cold component in which CO molecules are also found, with logN(CO)~15.
We study the chemical and physical conditions in the cold gas. We find that the
line of sight probes the gas deep after the HI-to-H2 transition in a ~4-5
pc-size cloud with volumic density nH~80 cm^-3 and temperature of only 50 K.
Our model suggests that the presence of small dust grains (down to about 0.001

are needed to explain the observed atomic and molecular abundances. The
presence of small grains is also in agreement with the observed steep
extinction curve that also features a 2175 A bump. The properties of this cloud
are very similar to what is seen in diffuse molecular regions of the nearby
Perseus complex. The high excitation temperature of CO rotational levels
towards J0000+0048 betrays however the higher temperature of the cosmic
microwave background. Using the derived physical conditions, we correct for a
small contribution (0.3 K) of collisional excitation and obtain TCMB(z =

(truncation) or data that only represent upper/lower limits (censoring). We

the presence of censoring and truncation. We use theoretical distribution
functions of the projected stellar radius $R \sin i$ to define a likelihood

magnitude bins are then obtained by a maximum likelihood parametric estimation
procedure. This method is capable of recovering the average stellar radius
within a few percent with as few as $\approx$ 10 measurements. Here it is
applied for the first time to the dataset available for the Pleiades. We find
an agreement better than $\approx$ 10 percent between the observed $R$ vs $M_K$

within 15 percent with no systematic deviations in the whole 1.2 $\ge

the eruption of twisted magnetic structures known as flux ropes. However, the
locations and mechanisms of such particle acceleration during the flare and
eruption are still subject to much investigation. Observing the exact sites of
particle acceleration can help confirm how the flare and eruption are initiated
are initiated and how they evolve. Here we use the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
to analyse a flare and erupting flux rope on 2014-April-18, while observations
from the Nancay Radio Astronomy Facility allows us to diagnose the sites of
electron acceleration during the eruption. Our analysis shows evidence for a
pre-formed flux rope which slowly rises and becomes destabilised at the time of
a C-class flare, plasma jet and the escape of &gt;75 keV electrons from rope
center into the corona. As the eruption proceeds, continued acceleration of
electrons with energies of ~5 keV occurs above the flux rope for a period over
5 minutes. At flare peak, one site of electron acceleration is located close to
the flare site while another is driven by the erupting flux rope into the
corona at speeds of up to 400 km/s. Energetic electrons then fill the erupting
volume, eventually allowing the flux rope legs to be clearly imaged from radio
sources at 150-445MHz. Following the analysis of Joshi et al. (2015), we
conclude that the sites of energetic electrons are consistent with flux rope
eruption via a tether-cutting or flux cancellation scenario inside a magnetic
fan-spine structure. In total, our radio observations allow us to better
understand the evolution of a flux rope eruption and its associated electron
acceleration sites, from eruption initiation to propagation into the corona.

<p>We attempt to quantify to what extent the vertical abundance profiles and the
integrated column densities of molecules predicted by a detailed gas-grain code
are affected by the treatment of the molecular hydrogen physisorption at the
surface of the grains. We performed three different models using the Nautilus
gas-grain code. One model uses a H2 binding energy on the surface of water (440
K) and produces strong sticking of H2. Another model uses a small binding
energy of 23 K (as if there were already a monolayer of H2), and the sticking
of H$_2$ is almost negligible. Finally, the remaining model is an intermediate

Cosmic-Ray Observatory. It is used to detect radio emission from extensive air
showers with energies beyond $10^{17}~$eV in the $30 - 80~$MHz frequency band.
After three phases of deployment, AERA now consists of more than 150 autonomous
radio stations with different spacings, covering an area of about $17~$km$^2$.
It is located at the same site as other Auger low-energy detector extensions
enabling combinations with various other measurement techniques. The radio
array allows different technical schemes to be explored as well as
cross-calibration of our measurements with the established baseline detectors
of the Auger Observatory. We report on the most recent technological
developments and give an overview of the experimental results obtained with
AERA. In particular, we will present the measurement of the radiation energy,
i.e., the amount of energy that is emitted by the air shower in the form of
radio emission, and its dependence on the cosmic-ray energy by comparing with
the measurement of the the well-calibrated Auger surface detector. Furthermore,
we outline the relevance of this result for the absolute calibration of the

lines, and these galactic building blocks can manifest as Damped Lyman-Alpha
Absorbers (DLAs) and Lyman Limit Systems (LLSs). We use radio observations of
Faraday effects to test whether DLAs and LLSs host a magnetised medium, by
combining DLA and LLS detections throughout the literature with 1.4 GHz
polarization data from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). We obtain a control, a
DLA, and a LLS sample consisting of 114, 19, and 27 lines-of-sight respectively
- all of which are polarized at $\ge8\sigma$ to ensure Rician bias is
negligible. Using a Bayesian framework, we are unable to detect either coherent
or random magnetic fields in DLAs: the regular coherent magnetic fields within
the DLAs must be $\le2.8$ $\mu$G, and the lack of depolarization is consistent
with the weakly magnetised gas in DLAs being non-turbulent and quiescent.
However, we find mild suggestive evidence that LLSs have coherent magnetic
fields: after controlling for the redshift-distribution of our data, we find a
71.5% probability that LLSs have a higher RM than a control sample. We also
find strong evidence that LLSs host random magnetic fields, with a 95.5%
probability that LLS lines-of-sight have lower polarized fractions than a
control sample. The regular coherent magnetic fields within the LLSs must be
$\le2.4$ $\mu$G, and the magnetised gas must be highly turbulent with a typical
scale on the order of $\approx5$-20 pc, which is similar to that of the Milky
Way. This is consistent with the standard dynamo pedagogy, whereby magnetic
fields in protogalaxies increase in coherence and strength as a function of
cosmic time. Our results are consistent with a hierarchical galaxy formation
scenario, with the DLAs, LLSs, and strong magnesium II (MgII) systems exploring
three different stages of magnetic field evolution in galaxies.

example those of the power spectrum and halo mass function which lead to the
squeezed-limit $n$-point function and halo bias, respectively. Using
quintessence dark energy as the paradigmatic example, we extend these
simulation techniques to cases where non-gravitational forces in other sectors
establish a Jeans scale across which the growth of density fluctuations becomes
scale dependent. By characterizing the separate universes with matching
background expansion histories, we show that the power spectrum and mass
function responses depend on whether the long-wavelength mode is above or below
the Jeans scale. Correspondingly, the squeezed bispectrum and halo bias also
become scale dependent. Models of bias that are effectively local in the
density field at a single epoch, initial or observed, cannot describe this
effect which highlights the importance of temporal nonlocality in structure
formation. Validated by these quintessence tests, our techniques are applicable

from sub-GeV up to several TeV using the Super-Kamiokande water Cherenkov
detector is presented in this paper. The energy and azimuthal spectra of the
atmospheric ${\nu}_e+{\bar{\nu}}_e$ and ${\nu}_{\mu}+{\bar{\nu}}_{\mu}$ fluxes
are measured. The energy spectra are obtained using an iterative unfolding
method by combining various event topologies with differing energy responses.
The azimuthal spectra depending on energy and zenith angle, and their
modulation by geomagnetic effects, are also studied. A predicted east-west
asymmetry is observed in both the ${\nu}_e$ and ${\nu}_{\mu}$ samples at 8.0
{\sigma} and 6.0 {\sigma} significance, respectively, and an indication that
the asymmetry dipole angle changes depending on the zenith angle was seen at
the 2.2 {\sigma} level. The measured energy and azimuthal spectra are
consistent with the current flux models within the estimated systematic
uncertainties. A study of the long-term correlation between the atmospheric
neutrino flux and the solar magnetic activity cycle is also performed, and a
weak indication of a correlation was seen at the 1.1 {\sigma} level, using SK
I-IV data spanning a 20 year period. For particularly strong solar activity
periods known as Forbush decreases, no theoretical prediction is available, but
a deviation below the typical neutrino event rate is seen at the 2.4 {\sigma}

"patchiness", while resolving millions of galaxy sources above ~10^8 Msun ,
combining gravitational and gas dynamics with radiative transfer. Modelling the
Local Group requires initial cosmological density fluctuations pre-selected to
form the well-known structures of the local universe today. Cosmic Dawn
("CoDa") is the first such fully-coupled, radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of
reionization of the local universe. Our new hybrid CPU-GPU code,
RAMSES-CUDATON, performs hundreds of radiative transfer and ionization
rate-solver timesteps on the GPUs for each hydro-gravity timestep on the CPUs.
CoDa simulated (91Mpc)^3 with 4096^3 particles and cells, to redshift 4.23, on
ORNL supercomputer Titan, utilizing 8192 cores and 8192 GPUs. Global
reionization ended slightly later than observed. However, a simple temporal
rescaling which brings the evolution of ionized fraction into agreement with
observations also reconciles ionizing flux density, cosmic star formation
history, CMB electron scattering optical depth and galaxy UV luminosity
function with their observed values. Photoionization heating suppressed the
star formation of haloes below ~2 x 10^9 Msun , decreasing the abun- dance of
faint galaxies around MAB_1600 = [-10,-12]. For most of reionization, star
formation was dominated by haloes between 10^10 - 10^11 Msun , so low-mass halo
suppression was not reflected by a distinct feature in the global star

the efficiency with which annihilation/decay products induce heating and
ionization in the intergalactic medium, and in this work extended them down to
a redshift of $1+z = 4$ for two different reionisation scenarios. We also
improve on earlier studies by using the results of detailed structure formation

$N$-body simulations, with estimates on the uncertainties that originate from
the smallest scales. We find that for dark matter models that are consistent
with experimental constraints, a contribution of more than 10% to the

temperatures of magnetars. (1) Heat flux from the liquid core heated by
ambipolar diffusion. It could sustain the observed surface luminosity
$L_s\approx 10^{35}$ erg/s if core heating offsets neutrino cooling at a
temperature $T_{core}&gt;6\times 10^8$ K. This scenario is viable if the core
magnetic field exceeds $10^{16}$ G and the heat-blanketing envelope of the
magnetar has a light element composition. We find however that the lifetime of
such a hot core should be shorter than the typical observed lifetime of
magnetars. (2) Mechanical dissipation in the solid crust. This heating can be
quasi-steady, powered by gradual (or frequent) crustal yielding to magnetic
stresses. We show that it obeys a strong upper limit. As long as the crustal
stresses are fostered by the field evolution in the core or Hall drift in the
crust, mechanical heating is insufficient to sustain persistent $L_s\approx
10^{35}$ erg/s. The surface luminosity is increased in an alternative scenario
of mechanical deformations triggered by external magnetospheric flares. (3)
Ohmic dissipation in the crust, in volume or current sheets. This mechanism is
inefficient because of the high conductivity of the crust. Only extreme
magnetic configurations with crustal fields $B&gt;10^{16}$ G varying on a 100
meter scale could provide $L_s\approx 10^{35}$ erg/s. (4) Bombardment of the
stellar surface by particles accelerated in the magnetosphere. This mechanism
produces hot spots on magnetars. Observations of transient magnetars show
evidence for external heating.

carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs). We focus on cases that have a total mass
in excess of the Chandrasekhar mass. After the merger, the remnant manifests as
an $L \sim 3 \times 10^4 L_\odot$ source for $\sim 10^4$ yr. A dusty wind may
develop, leading these sources to be self-obscured and to appear similar to
extreme AGB stars. Roughly $\sim 10$ such objects should exist in the Milky Way
and M31 at any time. As found in previous work, off-center carbon fusion is
ignited within the merger remnant and propagates inward via a carbon flame,
converting the WD to an oxygen-neon (ONe) composition. By following the
evolution for longer than previous calculations, we demonstrate that after
carbon-burning reaches the center, neutrino-cooled Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction
leads to off-center neon ignition in remnants with masses $\ge 1.35 M_\odot$.
The resulting neon-oxygen flame converts the core to a silicon WD. Thus,
super-Chandrasekhar WD merger remnants do not undergo electron-capture induced
collapse as traditionally assumed. Instead, if the remnant mass remains above
the Chandrasekhar mass, we expect that it will form a low-mass iron core and
collapse to form a neutron star. Remnants that lose sufficient mass will end up
as massive, isolated ONe or Si WDs.

higher energy, up to 30 GeV, and lower energy, down to 60 MeV. Moreover, the
new {\gamma}-ray data allow us to explore the spatial features of {\gamma}-ray

significance, our earlier finding on the extension of {\gamma}-ray emission
beyond the radio image. Moreover, the new analysis reveals significant spatial
variation of {\gamma}-ray spectra from both lobes. On the other hand, the
Planck observations at microwave frequencies contain important information on
spectra of synchrotron emission in the cutoff region, and thus allow
model-independent derivation of the strength of the magnetic field and the
distribution of relativistic electrons based on the combined {\gamma}-ray and

(SEDs) of the lobes within a pure leptonic model requires strong enhancement of
the magnetic field at the edge of the south lobe. Alternatively, a more

from Fe to Bi. Their simultaneous impact was studied in postprocessing
explosive trajectories for three different stellar models. It was found that
the grid of mass zones in the model of a 25 $M_\odot$ star, which is widely

uncertainties introduced by nuclear reaction uncertainties are smaller than a
factor of two. Since a large number of rates were varied at the same time in
the Monte Carlo procedure, possible cancellation effects of several
uncertainties could be taken into account. Key rates were identified for each
$p$ nucleus, which provide the dominant contribution to the production
uncertainty. These key rates were found by examining correlations between rate
variations and resulting abundance changes. This method is superior to studying

We demonstrate the quality of constraining the MBH spin that may be achieved,

ring. The radial position of this ringlet is observed to vary with time and
longitude, indicating that it is eccentric with an eccentricity of 0.0012 and
that its mean orbital radius varies between 139,300 km and 139,400 km. These
mean radii are consistent with material trapped in a co-orbital 1:1 resonance
with Prometheus. However, the apsidal precession rate of this ringlet is not
that expected for material close to Prometheus' orbit (2.76 degrees/day).
Instead, the ringlet appears to be precessing at the same rate as the F ring
(2.70 degrees/day). This ringlet therefore appears to consist of material
co-rotating with Prometheus whose apsidal precession rates have been modified
by interactions with F-ring material. This ringlet may therefore provide new
insights into how rings can maintain organized eccentric structures over a
range of semi-major axes

F5V star HD~157587 obtained with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) that reveal the
debris disk as a bright ring structure at a separation of $\sim$80$-$100~AU.
The new GPI data complement recent HST/STIS observations that show the disk
extending out to over 500~AU. The GPI image displays a strong asymmetry along
the projected minor axis as well as a fainter asymmetry along the projected
major axis. We associate the minor and major axis asymmetries with polarized
forward scattering and a possible stellocentric offset, respectively. To
constrain the disk geometry we fit two separate disk models to the polarized
image, each using a different scattering phase function. Both models favor a
disk inclination of $\sim 70\degr$ and a $1.5\pm0.6$ AU stellar offset in the
plane of the sky along the projected major axis of the disk. We find that the
stellar offset in the disk plane, perpendicular to the projected major axis is
degenerate with the form of the scattering phase function and remains poorly
constrained. The disk is not recovered in total intensity due in part to strong
adaptive optics residuals, but we recover three point sources. Considering the
system's proximity to the galactic plane and the point sources' positions
relative to the disk, we consider it likely that they are background objects
and unrelated to the disk's offset from the star.

They are sub-classified as CEMP- no Group-II stars, based on their location in
the Yoon-Beers diagram of absolute carbon abundance, A(C) vs. [Fe/H], as well
as on the conventional diagnostic [Ba/Fe]. The relatively low absolute carbon
abundances of CEMP-no stars, in combination with the high effective
temperatures of these two stars (Teff ~ 6500 K) weakens their CH molecular
features to the point that accurate carbon abundances can only be estimated
from spectra with very high S/N. A comparison of the observed abundance
patterns with the predicted yields from massive, metal-free supernova models
reduces the inferred progenitor masses by factors of ~ 2-3, and explosion
energies by factors of ~ 10-15, compared to those derived using previously
claimed carbon abundance estimates. There are certainly many more warm CEMP-no

the central molecular zone (CMZ) suggest the presence of a PeV cosmic-ray
accelerator (PeVatron) located in the inner 10 pc region of the Galactic
Center. Interestingly, the gamma-ray spectrum of the point-like source (HESS
J1745-290) in the Galactic Center shows a cutoff at ~10 TeV, implying a cutoff
around 100 TeV in the cosmic-ray proton spectrum. Here we propose that the
gamma-ray emission from the inner and the outer regions may be explained
self-consistently by run-away protons from a single, yet fading accelerator. In
this model, gamma rays from the CMZ region are produced by protons injected in
the past, while gamma rays from the inner region are produced by protons
injected more recently. We suggest that the blast wave formed in a tidal
disruption event (TDE) caused by the supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) could
serve as such a fading accelerator. With typical parameters of the TDE blast
wave, gamma-ray spectra of both the CMZ region and HESS J1745-290 can be
reproduced simultaneously. Meanwhile, we find that the cosmic-ray energy
density profile in the CMZ region may also be reproduced in the fading
accelerator model when appropriate combinations of the particle injection

More recent work, motivated within the context of self-force physics, extends
the procedure to metric perturbations sourced by a particle in a bound geodesic

stationary, axially-symmetric piece of the metric perturbation. In the vacuum
region away from the particle, this "completion" piece corresponds simply to
mass and angular-momentum perturbations of the Kerr background, with amplitudes
that are, however, a priori unknown. Here we present and implement a rigorous

off the particle, of certain gauge-invariant fields constructed from the full

neutron knockout reaction on $^6$He is investigated.In the present work, the
momentum distribution of the two emitted neutrons is calculated with the
$\alpha$~+~$n$~+~$n$ three-body model and a simple reaction model to assess the
effects of the knockout process via the $^5$He resonance and the target
dependence in the momentum distribution. A clear signature of the dineutron
correlation can be obtained by choosing the kinematical condition so the
process via the $^5$He resonance is excluded because the $^5$He resonance
drastically changes the momentum distribution. Using the proton target is
important in the quantitative discussion on the dineutron correlation by the
knockout reaction. In addition to theoretical arguments, a possible

Spin-dependent amplitude and observables.</a></summary><p>The forward Compton scattering off the proton is determined by substituting
the empirical total photoabsorption cross sections into dispersive sum rules.
In addition to the spin-independent amplitude evaluated previously [Phys. Rev.
D 92, 074031 (2015)], we obtain the spin-dependent amplitude over a broad
energy range. The two amplitudes contain all the information about this
process, and we, hence, can reconstruct the nonvanishing observables of the
proton Compton scattering in the forward kinematics. The results are compared
with predictions of chiral perturbation theory where available. The low-energy
expansion of the spin-dependent Compton scattering amplitude yields the
Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn (GDH) sum rule and relations for the forward spin
polarizabilities (FSPs) of the proton. Our evaluation provides an empirical
verification of the GDH sum rule for the proton, and yields empirical values of
the proton FSPs. For the GDH integral, we obtain $204.5(21.4)$ $\mu$b, in
agreement with the sum rule prediction: $204.784481(4)$ $\mu$b. For the FSPs,
we obtain: $\gamma_0=-92.9(10.5) \times 10^{-6}$ fm$^4$, and
$\bar{\gamma_0}=48.4(8.2) \times 10^{-6}$ fm$^6$, improving on the accuracy of

been quantified in a Monte Carlo procedure. Bespoke temperature-dependent
uncertainties were assigned to different types of reactions involving nuclei
from Fe to Bi. Their simultaneous impact was studied in postprocessing
explosive trajectories for three different stellar models. It was found that
the grid of mass zones in the model of a 25 $M_\odot$ star, which is widely
used for investigations of $p$ nucleosynthesis, is too crude to properly
resolve the detailed temperature changes required for describing the production
of $p$ nuclei. Using models with finer grids for 15 $M_\odot$ and 25 $M_\odot$
stars with initial solar metallicity, it was found that most of the production
uncertainties introduced by nuclear reaction uncertainties are smaller than a
factor of two. Since a large number of rates were varied at the same time in
the Monte Carlo procedure, possible cancellation effects of several
uncertainties could be taken into account. Key rates were identified for each
$p$ nucleus, which provide the dominant contribution to the production
uncertainty. These key rates were found by examining correlations between rate
variations and resulting abundance changes. This method is superior to studying
flow patterns, especially when the flows are complex, and to individual,
sequential variation of a few rates.

of small dimensions tend to contribute the largest terms to these sums, so a
systematic knowledge of these small representations could lead to proofs of

a language which seems to be adequate for the description of the "small"

condition on states of a quantum communication network that contains "backward
time-steps" in some of its branches. It has been argued that this is an
analogue for quantum processes in the presence of closed timelike curves
(CTCs). The unusual properties of states of quantum communication networks that
fulfill the D-CTC condition have been discussed extensively in recent
literature. In this work, the D-CTC condition is investigated in the framework
of quantum field theory in the local, operator-algebraic approach due to Haag
and Kastler. It is shown that the D-CTC condition cannot be fulfilled in states
which are analytic for the energy, or satisfy the Reeh-Schlieder property, for
a certain class of processes and initial conditions. On the other hand, if a
quantum field theory admits sufficiently many uncorrelated states across
acausally related spacetime regions (as implied by the split property), then
the D-CTC condition can always be fulfilled approximately to arbitrary
precision. As this result pertains to quantum field theory on globally
hyperbolic spacetimes where CTCs are absent, one may conclude that interpreting
the D-CTC condition as characteristic for quantum processes in the presence of
CTCs could be misleading, and should be regarded with caution. Furthermore, a
construction of the quantized massless Klein-Gordon field on the Politzer
spacetime, often viewed as spacetime analogue for quantum communication
networks with backward time-steps, is proposed in this work.

states are edge states which are stable against spatially localized (even

Hall effect, protected edge states have attracted huge interest due to their
role in the field of topological insulators. Theoretical understanding of
topological protection has mainly come from discrete (tight-binding) models and
direct numerical simulation. In this paper we consider a rich family of
continuum PDE models for which we rigorously study regimes where topologically
protected edge states exist. Our model is a class of Schroedinger operators on
$\mathbb{R}^2$ with a background 2D honeycomb potential perturbed by an
"edge-potential". The edge potential is a domain-wall interpolation, transverse
to a prescribed "rational" edge, between two distinct periodic structures.
General conditions are given for the bifurcation of a branch of topologically
protected edge states from Dirac points of the background honeycomb structure.
The bifurcation is seeded by the zero mode of a 1D effective Dirac operator. A
key condition is a spectral no-fold condition for the prescribed edge. We then
use this result to prove the existence of topologically protected edge states
along zigzag edges of certain honeycomb structures. Our results are consistent
with the physics literature and appear to be the first rigorous results on the
existence of topologically protected edge states for continuum 2D PDE systems

accurately describes the full quantum theory when the occupancy numbers of
systems are very large. However, the situation is less understood in
interacting theories, especially on time scales longer than the dynamical
relaxation time. Recently there have been claims that the quantum theory
deviates spectacularly from the classical theory on this time scale, even if
the occupancy numbers are extremely large. Furthermore, it is claimed that the
quantum theory quickly thermalizes while the classical theory does not. The
evidence for these claims comes from noticing a spectacular difference in the
time evolution of expectation values of quantum operators compared to the
classical micro-state evolution. If true, this would have dramatic consequences
for many important phenomena, including laboratory studies of interacting BECs,
dark matter axions, preheating after inflation, etc. In this work we critically
examine these claims. We show that in fact the classical theory can describe
the quantum behavior in the high occupancy regime, even when interactions are
large. The connection is that the expectation values of quantum operators in a
single quantum micro-state are approximated by the corresponding classical
ensemble average over many classical micro-states. Furthermore, by the ergodic
theorem, the classical ensemble average of local fields with statistical
translation invariance is the spatial average of a single micro-state. So the
correlation functions of the quantum and classical field theories of a single
micro-state approximately agree at high occupancy, even in interacting systems.
Furthermore, both quantum and classical field theories can thermalize, when
appropriate coarse graining is introduced, with the classical case requiring a
cutoff on low occupancy UV modes. We discuss applications of our results.

time-steps" in some of its branches. It has been argued that this is an
analogue for quantum processes in the presence of closed timelike curves
(CTCs). The unusual properties of states of quantum communication networks that
fulfill the D-CTC condition have been discussed extensively in recent
literature. In this work, the D-CTC condition is investigated in the framework
of quantum field theory in the local, operator-algebraic approach due to Haag
and Kastler. It is shown that the D-CTC condition cannot be fulfilled in states
which are analytic for the energy, or satisfy the Reeh-Schlieder property, for
a certain class of processes and initial conditions. On the other hand, if a
quantum field theory admits sufficiently many uncorrelated states across
acausally related spacetime regions (as implied by the split property), then
the D-CTC condition can always be fulfilled approximately to arbitrary
precision. As this result pertains to quantum field theory on globally
hyperbolic spacetimes where CTCs are absent, one may conclude that interpreting
the D-CTC condition as characteristic for quantum processes in the presence of
CTCs could be misleading, and should be regarded with caution. Furthermore, a

related to the final energy state of the thermometer. A recent paper noted that
different-temperature baths lead not only to different equilibrium states but
also to different equilibration rates. In some cases this means that
temperature discrimination is better achieved by comparing the rates than the
asymptotic states -- and should therefore be carried out at finite times rather
than once equilibration is essentially complete. The theory work also noted
that for a \emph{quantum} thermometer, the difference between the relaxation
rates for populations and coherences means that for intermediate time regimes
(before full equilibration but after some characteristic time that depends on
the temperatures of the baths), optimal discrimination is achieved not by
probing energy only but by using quantum coherence as well. In this work, we
study these effects experimentally. Implementing a recent proposal for
efficiently emulating an arbitrary quantum channel, we use the quantum

We investigate the optimal thermometer states for temperature discrimination,

measurement, and communication. This has stimulated the research in different
areas of physics to engineer and manipulate fragile many-particle entangled
states. Progress has been particularly rapid for atoms. Thanks to the large and
tunable nonlinearities and the well developed techniques for trapping,
controlling and counting, many groundbreaking experiments have demonstrated the
generation of entangled states of trapped ions, cold and ultracold gases of
neutral atoms. Moreover, atoms can couple strongly to external forces and light
fields, which makes them ideal for ultra-precise sensing and time keeping. All
these factors call for generating non-classical atomic states designed for
phase estimation in atomic clocks and atom interferometers, exploiting
many-body entanglement to increase the sensitivity of precision measurements.
The goal of this article is to review and illustrate successful theoretical
proposals and experiments with atomic ensembles that have demonstrated
many-particle entanglement and quantum-enhanced metrology.

(OTOC) may serve as a useful characteristic of quantum-chaotic behavior,
because in the semi-classical limit, $\hbar \to 0$, its rate of exponential
growth resembles the classical Lyapunov exponent. Here, we calculate the
four-point correlator, $C(t)$, for the classical and quantum kicked rotor -- a
textbook driven chaotic system -- and compare its growth rate at initial times
with the standard definition of the classical Lyapunov exponent. Using both
quantum and classical arguments, we show that the OTOC's growth rate and the
Lyapunov exponent are in general distinct quantities, corresponding to the
logarithm of phase-space averaged divergence rate of classical trajectories and
to the phase-space average of the logarithm, respectively. The difference
appears to be more pronounced in the regime of low kicking strength, where no
classical chaos exists globally. In this case, the Lyapunov exponent vanishes,
while the OTOC's growth rate may remain finite corresponding to disconnected
local chaotic islands in the phase space. We also show that the quantum
correlator as a function of time exhibits a clear singularity at the Ehrenfest
time $t_E$: transitioning from a time-independent value of $t^{-1} \ln{C(t)}$
at $t &lt; t_E$ to its monotonous decrease with time at $t&gt;t_E$. We note that the
underlying physics here is the same as in the theory of weak dynamical
localization [Tian, Kamenev, and Larkin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 124101 (2004)]

Schroedinger, Maxwell, which is propagating (plane-wave-like) parallel to, and
localized transverse to, a line-defect or "edge". Topologically protected edge
states are edge states which are stable against spatially localized (even
strong) deformations of the edge. First studied in the context of the quantum
Hall effect, protected edge states have attracted huge interest due to their
role in the field of topological insulators. Theoretical understanding of
topological protection has mainly come from discrete (tight-binding) models and
direct numerical simulation. In this paper we consider a rich family of
continuum PDE models for which we rigorously study regimes where topologically
protected edge states exist. Our model is a class of Schroedinger operators on
$\mathbb{R}^2$ with a background 2D honeycomb potential perturbed by an
"edge-potential". The edge potential is a domain-wall interpolation, transverse
to a prescribed "rational" edge, between two distinct periodic structures.
General conditions are given for the bifurcation of a branch of topologically
protected edge states from Dirac points of the background honeycomb structure.
The bifurcation is seeded by the zero mode of a 1D effective Dirac operator. A
key condition is a spectral no-fold condition for the prescribed edge. We then
use this result to prove the existence of topologically protected edge states
along zigzag edges of certain honeycomb structures. Our results are consistent
with the physics literature and appear to be the first rigorous results on the
existence of topologically protected edge states for continuum 2D PDE systems
describing waves in a non-trivial periodic medium. We also show that the family
of Hamiltonians we study contains cases where zigzag edge states exist, but
which are not topologically protected.

purposes and also they are unaware of potential electrical consumption
reduction level they could make by changing their consumption behaviors or
investing in new efficient technology products. Providing electrical
consumption information to household and make the consumption information
tangible is very effective strategy in reducing electrical consumption in
households. In Home Displays provide consumers real time information on
electrical consumption level and related expenditure, with that strategy
turning an intangible electric bill into transparent and controllable is
possible. We interviewed the participants before the start to our study in
order to have knowledge of their income, environmental attitudes and the
knowledge level of their electrical consumption conserving activities.
Monitoring over 3 to 5 months maximal of five households electrical consumption
and comparing that consumption level with the previous year had been realized.
Households received advanced real time appliance level feedback. Behavioral
change associated electrical consumption reduction levels were identified. It
is also realized that setting goals via an electrical energy consumption
display have high potential on reducing the total electricity consumption in
households. We found 0, 0, 13.21, 3.42, 1.59 % electricity savings on house 1,
house 2, house 3, house 4 and house 5 correspondingly. It is suggested that
further attention need to be given on potential reduction effect of applying
different type of monitor designs and implication of special designed
stimulants that can be used all over the house that can alert households with
their current consumption level. Also, it is suggested to concentrate on time

database is an important, but difficult task. State-of-the-art techniques rely
on optimised sequential scans or tree-based structures. For range queries with
small result sets, sequential scans exhibit poor asymptotic performance. Also,
as the dimensionality of the data set increases, the performance of tree-based
structures degenerates due to the curse of dimensionality. Recent literature
proposed the Elf, a main-memory structure that is optimised for the case of
such multi-dimensional low-selectivity queries. The Elf outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods in manually tuned scenarios. However, choosing an
optimal parameter configuration for the Elf is vital, since for poor
configurations, the search performance degrades rapidly. Consequently, further
knowledge about the behaviour of the Elf in different configurations is
required to achieve robust performance. In this thesis, we therefore propose a
numerical cost model for the Elf. Like all main-memory index structures, the
Elf response time is not dominated by disk accesses, refusing a straightforward
analysis. Our model predicts the size and shape of the Elf region that is
examined during search. We propose that the response time of a search is linear
to the size of this region. Furthermore, we study the impact of skewed data
distributions and correlations on the shape of the Elf. We find that they lead
to behaviour that is accurately describable through simple reductions in
attribute cardinality. Our experimental results indicate that for data sets of
up to 15 dimensions, our cost model predicts the size of the examined Elf
region with relative errors below 5%. Furthermore, we find that the size of the
Elf region examined during search predicts the response time with an accuracy
of 80%.

However, a desirable natural user interface should be able to understand user's

particular promising paradigm for achieving such deep neural networks is the
concept of evolutionary deep intelligence, which attempts to mimic biological
evolution processes to synthesize highly-efficient deep neural networks over
successive generations that retain high modeling capabilities. An important
aspect of evolutionary deep intelligence that is particular interesting and
worth deeper investigation is the genetic encoding scheme used to mimic
heredity, which can have a significant impact on the way architectural traits

descendant deep neural networks. Motivated by the neurobiological phenomenon of
synaptic clustering, where the probability of synaptic co-activation increases
for correlated synapses encoding similar information that are close together on
the same dendrite, we introduce a new genetic encoding scheme where synaptic
probability within a deep neural network is driven towards the formation of
highly sparse synaptic clusters. Experimental results for the task of image

using this synaptic cluster-driven genetic encoding scheme can achieve

economically outsource their large scale computations to a public cloud with
huge computational power. Cloud has the massive storage, computational power
and software which can be used by clients for reducing their computational
overhead and storage limitation. But in case of outsourcing, privacy of
client's confidential data must be maintained. We have designed a protocol for
outsourcing large scale Eigen value problem to a malicious cloud which provides
input/output data security, result verifiability and client's efficiency. As
the direct computation method to find all eigenvectors is computationally
expensive for large dimensionality, we have used power iterative method for
finding the largest Eigen value and the corresponding Eigen vector of a matrix.
For protecting the privacy, some transformations are applied to the input
matrix to get encrypted matrix which is sent to the cloud and then decrypting
the result that is returned from the cloud for getting the correct solution of
Eigen value problem. We have also proposed result verification mechanism for
detecting robust cheating and provided theoretical analysis and experimental
result that describes high-efficiency, correctness, security and robust
cheating resistance of the proposed protocol.

combinations of these characteristics are used for classification. The
combination contains only with single feature or with fusion of two features or
fusion of all three features considered at a time respectively. Further, the
system categorizes the logo image into: a logo image with fully text or with
fully symbols or containing both symbols and texts.. The K-Nearest Neighbour
(K-NN) classifier is used for classification. Due to the lack of color logo
image dataset in the literature, the same is created consisting 5044 color logo

through accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure computed from the confusion

of wireless networks (5G) will enable coexistence of newly introduced services
with legacy cellular networks. These new services, like Device-To-Device (D2D)
communication, should require limited synchronization with the legacy cell to
limit the amount of signaling overhead in the network. However, it is known
that Cyclic Prefix-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP-OFDM) used in
Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) is not fit for asynchronous environments.
This has motivated the search for a new waveform, able to enhance coexistence
with CP-OFDM. Namely, it has been widely suggested that new devices could use
OFDM/Offset-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (OFDM/OQAM) to reduce the
interference they inject to legacy cellular users. However, values of
interference are usually measured at the input antenna of the receiver, based
on the PSD of the interfering signal. We showed in previous works that this
measurement is not representative of the actual interference that is seen after
the demodulation operations. Building on this finding, we provide in this paper
the first exact closed forms of cross-interference between OFDM/OQAM and
CP-OFDM users. Our results prove that using OFDM/OQAM only marginally reduces
interference to legacy users, in contradiction with many results in the
literature.

presentation attacks, assuming that their matching score distribution is
identical to that of genuine users, without fabricating any fake trait. We have
recently shown that this assumption is not representative of current
fingerprint and face presentation attacks, leading one to overestimate the
vulnerability of multibiometric systems, and to design less effective fusion

meta-model of face and fingerprint presentation attacks that characterizes a
wider family of fake score distributions, including distributions of known and,
potentially, unknown attacks. This allows us to perform a thorough security
evaluation of multibiometric systems against presentation attacks, quantifying
how their vulnerability may vary also under attacks that are different from
those considered during design, through an uncertainty analysis. We empirically
show that our approach can reliably predict the performance of multibiometric
systems even under never-before-seen face and fingerprint presentation attacks,
and that the secure fusion rules designed using our approach can exhibit an
improved trade-off between the performance in the absence and in the presence
of attack. We finally argue that our method can be extended to other biometrics

Under this assumption, the joint registration problem is cast into a

over a previously known pseudo-polynomial time estimate, i.e.
$\Theta\big(|V|^2|E|W + \sum_{v\in
V}\texttt{deg}_{\Gamma}(v)\cdot\ell_{\Gamma}(v)\big)$ \citep{CR15, CR16}, as
the pseudo-polynomiality is now confined to depend solely on $\ell_\Gamma$.
Secondly, we further explore on the relationship between Optimal Positional
Strategies (OPSs) in \MPG{s} and Small Energy-Progress Measures (SEPMs) in
reweighted \EG{s}. It is observed that the space of all OPSs,
$\texttt{opt}_{\Gamma}\Sigma^M_0$, admits a unique complete decomposition in
terms of extremal-SEPM{s} in reweighted EG{s}. This points out what we called
the "Energy-Lattice $\mathcal{X}^*_{\Gamma}$ associated to
$\texttt{opt}_{\Gamma}\Sigma^M_0$". Finally, it is offered a pseudo-polynomial
total-time recursive procedure for enumerating (w/o repetitions) all the
elements of $\mathcal{X}^*_{\Gamma}$, and for computing the corresponding
partitioning of $\texttt{opt}_{\Gamma}\Sigma^M_0$.

high-resolution images are two coupled subproblems of multi-frame
super-resolution. This paper introduces a new joint optimization approach for
motion estimation and image reconstruction to address this interdependence. Our
method is formulated via non-linear least squares optimization and combines two
principles of robust super-resolution. First, to enhance the robustness of the
joint estimation, we propose a confidence-aware energy minimization framework
augmented with sparse regularization. Second, we develop a tailor-made
Levenberg-Marquardt iteration scheme to jointly estimate motion parameters and
the high-resolution image along with the corresponding model confidence

as a special averaging technique (SAT), which consists of wavelet
transformation in its first stage, a globally statistical adaptive detecting
algorithm as a second stage; and in the third stage it replaces the affected
peaks by making use of moving average filter process. In the NN work, the
learning process makes use of a previously published work that is based on
three linear coding techniques. In order to check the proposed work validity, a
MATLAB simulation has been run and has two main variables to compare with;
namely BER and CCDF curves. This is true under the same bandwidth occupancy and
channel characteristics. Two types of tested data have been used; randomly
generated data and a practical data that have been extracted from a funded
project entitled by ECEM. From the achieved simulation results, the work that
is based on SAT shows promising results in reducing the PAPR effect reached up
to 80% over the work in the literature and our previously published work. This
means that this work gives an extra reduction up to 15% of our previously
published work. However, this achievement will be under the cost of complexity.
This penalty could be optimized by imposing the NN to the SAT work in order to

way functions (OWF). Starting from a provably intractable decision problem
$L_D$ (whose existence is nonconstructively assured from the well-known
discrete time-hierarchy theorem from complexity theory), we construct another
intractable decision problem $L\subseteq \{0,1\}^*$ that has its words
scattered across $\{0,1\}^\ell$ at a relative frequency $p(\ell)$, for which
upper and lower bounds can be worked out. The value $p(\ell)$ is computed from
the density of the language within $\{0,1\}^\ell$ divided by the total word
count $2^\ell$. It corresponds to the probability of retrieving a yes-instance
of a decision problem upon a uniformly random draw from $\{0,1\}^\ell$. The
trick to find a language with known bounds on $p(\ell)$ relies on switching
from $L_D$ to $L_0:=L_D\cap L'$, where $L'$ is an easy-to-decide language with
a known density across $\{0,1\}^*$. In defining $L'$ properly (and upon a
suitable G\"odel numbering), the hardness of deciding $L_D\cap L'$ is inherited
from $L_D$, while its density is controlled by that of $L'$. The lower and
upper approximation of $p(\ell)$ then let us construct an explicit threshold
function (as in random graph theory) that can be used to efficiently and
intentionally sample yes- or no-instances of the decision problem (language)
$L_0$ (however, without any auxiliary information that could ease the decision
like a polynomial witness). In turn, this allows to construct a weak OWF that
encodes a bit string $w\in\{0,1\}^*$ by efficiently (in polynomial time)
emitting a sequence of randomly constructed intractable decision problems,
whose answers correspond to the preimage $w$.

vertices of a complete graph are trying to meet at some vertex at the same
time. It is well-known that if the parties have predetermined roles, then the
strategy where one of them waits at one vertex, while the other visits all $n$
vertices in random order is optimal, taking at most $n$ steps and averaging
about $n/2$. Anderson and Weber considered the symmetric rendezvous problem,
where both parties must use the same randomized strategy. They analyzed
strategies where the parties repeatedly play the optimal asymmetric strategy,
determining their role independently each time by a biased coin-flip. By tuning
the bias, Anderson and Weber achieved an expected meeting time of about $0.829
n$, which they conjectured to be asymptotically optimal.
</p>
<p>We change perspective slightly: instead of minimizing the expected meeting
time, we seek to maximize the probability of meeting within a specified time
$T$. The Anderson-Weber strategy, which fails with constant probability when
$T= \Theta(n)$, is not asymptotically optimal for large $T$ in this setting.
Specifically, we exhibit a symmetric strategy that succeeds with probability
$1-o(1)$ in $T=4n$ steps. This is tight: for any $\alpha &lt; 4$, any symmetric
strategy with $T = \alpha n$ fails with constant probability. Our strategy uses
a new combinatorial object that we dub a "rendezvous code," which may be of
independent interest.
</p>
<p>When $T \le n$, we show that the probability of meeting within $T$ steps is
indeed asymptotically maximized by the Anderson-Weber strategy. Our results
imply new lower bounds, showing that the best symmetric strategy takes at least
$0.638 n$ steps in expectation. We also present some partial results for the

the evidence-based medicine (EBM) paradigm, but these are available primarily
as unstructured text and are generally highly heterogeneous in nature. This
significantly reduces the dissemination and automatic application of these
recommendations at the point of care. A comprehensive structured representation
of these recommendations is highly beneficial in this regard. Objective: The
objective of this paper to present Clinical Recommendation Type System (CRTS),
a common type system that can effectively represent a clinical recommendation
in a structured form. Methods: CRTS is built by analyzing 125 recommendations
and 195 research articles corresponding to 6 different diseases available from
UpToDate, a publicly available clinical knowledge system, and from the National
Guideline Clearinghouse, a public resource for evidence-based clinical practice
guidelines. Results: We show that CRTS not only covers the recommendations but
also is flexible to be extended to represent information from primary
literature. We also describe how our developed type system can be applied for
clinical decision support, medical knowledge summarization, and citation
retrieval. Conclusion: We showed that our proposed type system is precise and
comprehensive in representing a large sample of recommendations available for
various disorders. CRTS can now be used to build interoperable information
extraction systems that automatically extract clinical recommendations and
related data elements from clinical evidence resources, guidelines, systematic

typically relegated to clinical research study coordinators. However, a major
obstacle is the vast amount of patient data available as unstructured free-form

eligibility criteria using a rule-based system to determine which patients
qualify for enrollment in a heart failure clinical trial. We show that we can
achieve highly accurate results, with recall and precision values of 0.95 and
0.86, respectively. Our system allowed us to significantly reduce the time

open-source information extraction modules are available for researchers and
could be tested and validated in other cardiovascular trials. An approach such
as the one we demonstrate here may decrease costs and expedite clinical trials,

back-propagation algorithm, where the gradient for learning is provided by
back-propagating the error, layer by layer, from the output layer to the hidden
layers. A recently discovered method called feedback-alignment shows that the
weights used for propagating the error backward don't have to be symmetric with
the weights used for propagation the activation forward. In fact, random
feedback weights work evenly well, because the network learns how to make the
feedback useful. In this work, the feedback alignment principle is used for
training hidden layers more independently from the rest of the network, and
from a zero initial condition. The error is propagated through fixed random
feedback connections directly from the output layer to each hidden layer. This
simple method is able to achieve zero training error even in convolutional
networks and very deep networks, completely without error back-propagation. The
method is a step towards biologically plausible machine learning because the
error signal is almost local, and no symmetric or reciprocal weights are
required. Experiments show that the test performance on MNIST and CIFAR is
almost as good as those obtained with back-propagation for fully connected
networks. If combined with dropout, the method achieves 1.45% error on the

true color of scene by first inferring the light source color and then
discounting it from the captured color biased image. However, the image colors
are determined not only by the illuminant but also by the camera spectral
sensitivity (CSS). This paper studies the CSS effects on CC performance by
showing the insufficiency of existing learning-based CC algorithms when dealing
with the situation of so called inter-dataset-based CC, i.e., training a CC
model on one dataset and then testing it on another dataset that was captured
by a distinct CSS. This is a key drawback that limits the wide application of
many existing CC models. To overcome this problem, we propose a simple way to
solve this problem by firstly learning a transform matrix that converts the
responses to the illuminant and images under one CSS into those under another
CSS. Then, the learned matrix is used to transform the data rendered under one
CSS into another specific CSS before applying the CC model on another dataset.
Theoretical analysis and experimental validation on synthetic, hyperspectral,
and real camera captured images show that the proposed method can significantly
improve the inter-dataset-based performance for traditional CC algorithms.
Thus, we suggest that for better generalization of the state-of-the-art CC
algorithms, the effect of CSS should be reasonably considered.

techniques are usually distorted and each separated source contains residual
signals from the other sources. To tackle this problem, we propose to enhance
the separated sources by decreasing the distortion and interference between the
separated sources using deep neural networks (DNNs). Two different DNNs are
used in this work. The first DNN is used to separate the sources from the mixed
signal. The second DNN is used to enhance the separated signals. To consider
the interactions between the separated sources, we propose to use a single DNN
to enhance all the separated sources together. To reduce the residual signals
of one source from the other separated sources (interference), we train the DNN
for enhancement discriminatively to maximize the dissimilarity between the
predicted sources. The experimental results show that using discriminative
enhancement decreases the distortion and interference between the separated

extant species (taxa), and the internal vertices represent ancestral species.
The evolutionary history of a set of species can be explained by more than one
phylogenetic tree, giving rise to the problem of comparing phylogenetic trees
for similarity. Various distance metrics, like the subtree prune-and-regraft
(SPR), tree bisection reconnection (TBR) and nearest neighbour interchange
(NNI) have been proposed to capture this similarity. The distance between two
phylogenetic trees can also be measured by the size of a Maximum Agreement
Forest (MAF) on these trees, as it has been shown that the rooted subtree
prune-and-regraft distance is 1 less than the size of a MAF. Since computing a
MAF of minimum size is an NP-hard problem, approximation algorithms are of
interest. Recently, it has been shown that the MAF on k(&gt;=2) trees can be
approximated to within a factor of 8. In this paper, we improve this ratio to
3. For certain species, however, the evolutionary history is not completely
tree-like. Due to reticulate evolution two gene trees, though related, appear
different, making a phylogenetic network a more appropriate representation of
reticulate evolution. A phylogenetic network contains hybrid nodes for the
species evolved from two parents. The number of such nodes is its hybridization
number. It has been shown that this number is 1 less than the size of a Maximum

either non-dictatorial aggregation is possible in a society of only two members
or a ternary aggregator exists that either on every issue $j$ is a majority

the corresponding component satisfies $f_j(x,x,y) = f_j(x,y,x) = f_j(y,x,x) =y,

Then making use of Bulatov's dichotomy theorem for conservative constraint

is the inverse of a large, sparse matrix, which is the focus of this paper.
When the evaluation of the function is expensive, the task is computationally
challenging because the standard approach is based on a Monte Carlo method
which converges slowly. We present a different approach that exploits the
pattern correlation, if present, between the diagonal of the inverse of the

quality of the approximate inverse, our method may serve as a standalone kernel
for providing a fast trace estimate with a small number of samples.
Furthermore, the method can be used as a variance reduction method for Monte

some real applications demonstrate the potential of our method.

examples of such markets on the web and in electronic commerce. Many of these
examples represent dynamic and uncertain environments, and thus, require, in
fact, online mechanisms. Unfortunately, as far as we know, no previously
published online mechanism for a multi-sided market (or even for a double-sided
market) has managed to (approximately) maximize the gain from trade, while
guaranteeing desirable economic properties such as incentivizing truthfulness,
voluntary participation and avoiding budget deficit. In this work we present
the first online mechanism for a multi-sided market which has the above
properties. Our mechanism is designed for a market setting suggested by
[Feldman and Gonen (2016)]; which is motivated by the foreseeable future form

</p>
<p>The online nature of our setting motivated us to define a stronger notion of
individual rationality, called "continuous individual rationality", capturing
the natural requirement that a player should never lose either by participating
in the mechanism or by not leaving prematurely. Satisfying the requirements of
continuous individual rationality, together with the other economic properties
our mechanism guarantees, requires the mechanism to use a novel pricing scheme
where users may be paid ongoing increments during the mechanism's execution up
to a pre-known maximum value. As users rarely ever get paid in reality, this
pricing scheme is new to mechanism design. Nevertheless, the principle it is
based on can be observed in many common real life scenarios such as executive
compensation payments and company acquisition deals. We believe both our new
dynamic pricing scheme concept and our strengthened notion of individual

with limited-size local cache storage. The central computing unit (cloud) is
connected to the BSs via a limited capacity backhaul link and serves a set of
single-antenna mobile users (MUs). This paper assumes that only imperfect
channel state information (CSI) is available at the cloud. It focuses on the
problem of minimizing the total network power and backhaul cost so as to
determine the beamforming vector of each user across the network, the
quantization noise covariance matrix, and the BS clustering subject to
imperfect channel state information and fixed cache placement assumptions. The
paper suggests solving such a difficult, non-convex optimization problem using
the semidefinite relaxation (SDR). The paper then uses the $\ell_0$-norm
approximation to provide a feasible, sub-optimal solution using the
majorization-minimization (MM) approach. Simulation results particularly show
how the cache-enabled network significantly improves the backhaul cost
especially at high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) values as
compared to conventional cache-less CRANs.

in solving structured prediction problems such as semantic segmentation, it
remains a challenge to differentiate individual object instances in the scene.
Instance segmentation is very important in a variety of applications, such as
autonomous driving, image captioning, and visual question answering. Techniques
that combine large graphical models with low-level vision have been proposed to
address this problem; however, we propose an end-to-end recurrent neural

shaped by a small set of influencers through a cascading process induced by
"peer pressure". For large-scale networks, efficient identification of multiple
influential spreaders with a linear algorithm in threshold models that exhibit
a first-order transition still remains a challenging task. Here we address this
issue by exploring the collective influence in general threshold models of

fixed by the subcritical paths along which cascades propagate: the number of
subcritical paths attached to each spreader determines its contribution to
global cascades. The concept of subcritical path allows us to introduce a
linearly scalable algorithm for massively large-scale networks. Results in both
synthetic random graphs and real networks show that the proposed method can
achieve larger collective influence given same number of seeds compared with

a central question in network theory. Recently, a scalable method called
"Collective Influence (CI)" has been put forward through collective influence
maximization. In contrast to heuristic methods evaluating nodes' significance
separately, CI method inspects the collective influence of multiple spreaders.
Despite that CI applies to the influence maximization problem in percolation

spreading. Here, we examine real-world information flow in various social and
scientific platforms including American Physical Society, Facebook, Twitter and
LiveJournal. Since empirical data cannot be directly mapped to ideal
multi-source spreading, we leverage the behavioral patterns of users extracted
from data to construct "virtual" information spreading processes. Our results
demonstrate that the set of spreaders selected by CI can induce larger scale of
information propagation. Moreover, local measures as the number of connections

in realistic information spreading. This result has significance for rankings

OSIRIS-REx will survey the asteroid for 2 years after it arrives in 2018, then tag Bennu for 5 seconds to retrieve its dust. Although it won't be the first spacecraft to return an asteroid sample, the scoop of grit OSIRIS-REx delivers in 2023 could reveal new insights into the unaltered building blocks of the solar system and the types of amino acids and other organic molecules that asteroid impacts delivered to an early Earth.

This week, the first of 1500 researchers and support staff begin moving in from two major biomedical institutes. Collaborators will join them from three universities in London and a pharmaceutical company. But the United Kingdom's vote in June to leave the European Union has dampened some of the elation. Restrictions on migration could make it more difficult to recruit from overseas, and limited access to EU research funds could squeeze the operating budget. Some domestic observers worry that it will suck up so much talent and funding that universities outside London will suffer, but supporters say the Crick will strengthen science nationwide.

For years, researchers and drug developers have worried that standard preclinical tests for cardiac safety are actually too conservative, and may lead drugmakers to abandon promising and safe treatments early in development. Since 2013, an international team of regulators, academic researchers, and drug companies have been validating a more sophisticated set of tests, known as the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA). That painstaking process is inching toward completion. In the coming weeks, a key component of that assay, based on stem cellderived heart cells, will undergo blind testing on drugs with known risks at various academic and industry labs, and the CiPA collaborators hope to propose a new set of testing standards by the end of next year.

If successful, the suitbrought under the federal False Claims Act (FCA)could force Duke to return to the government up to three times the amount of any ill-gotten funds, and produce a multimillion-dollar payout to the whistleblower. The Duke case "should scare all [academic] institutions around the country," says attorney Joel Androphy of Berg &amp; Androphy in Houston, Texas, who specializes in false claims litigation. It appears to be one of the largest FCA suits ever to focus on research misconduct in academia, he says, and, if successful, could "open the floodgates" to other whistleblowing cases. Although relatively few FCA cases have targeted research universities, that's changing. And although recent court rulings suggest public universities may have some protection from FCA suits because they are government entities, private institutions do not. Eleven private universities, including Duke, are among the top 25 academic recipients of federal research dollars in recent years.

Lawmakers aren't likely to pare that list by much before they leave next month to campaign in advance of the 8 November elections. They might give some issues a second look after the election, however, when they return for a lame duck session. The one big responsibility Congress can't shirk is passing some kind of spending bill to keep the government running for the 2017 fiscal year, which begins on 1 October. Lawmakers are expected to put off a final decision by temporarily extending 2016 spending levels into 2017 with a so-called continuing resolution (CR). A CR means the budgets of federal research agencies will be frozen: Administrators won't be able to start new programs or benefit from the spending hikes envisioned in some preliminary appropriations bills awaiting final action. They include a hefty proposed increase for the National Institutes of Health, another big boost for a NASA mission to a jovian moon, a new Coast Guard icebreaker that would enhance polar research, and a third midsized research vessel for the U.S. academic fleet. A CR also would leave hanging major disagreements between the House of Representatives and the Senate on whether to continue U.S. participation in ITER, the costly international fusion project, and how much earth science NASA should carry out.

Even before it was publicly announced, divisions within the diversity community prompted NIH officials to take the unusual step of adding to its leadership team a scientist who had been part of a group that lost out in the competition to create the network. And earlier this year, the principal investigator for the multisite network resigned after continuing conflicts with NIH officials over the initiative's direction. NIH officials admit that 4 decades' worth of programs aimed at removing obstacles to participation by underrepresented groups haven't moved the needle very much. And NRMN's supporters are worried that NIH may also end the network prematurely if it falls short of some short-term, quantitative goals.

Now, researchers are trying to extend this cutting-edge treatment to people with solid tumors, like those spreading through the breasts, lungs, brain, and ovaries. Solid tumors are far more common than blood cancers and, if they metastasize, can be very difficult to treat. Doctors hope that the first wave of clinical trials will help chart a path toward success for a strategy that could upend cancer treatment as we know it. But the last few years have been humbling as well as exhilarating. To melt away solid tumors, T cell therapy must clear daunting hurdles it didn't face in blood cancers. So far there are glimmers of T cells' power, but nothing close to what blood cancer patients have experienced. Now, physicians are trying to figure out how to improve the odds of success while keeping risky side effects to a minimum.

Air pockets in feathers, furs, and woolen fabrics help reduce thermal conduction and keep warmth inside. Cooling, however, is much harder to achieve without the use of external active devices such as fans, air conditioners, or wearable thermoelectric coolers. The wicking technology used in modern athletic apparel to enhance convective cooling is not ideal for everyday clothes because it only works once perspiration begins. On page 1019 of this issue, Hsu et al. (1) report passive cooling of an object by a few Celsius degrees by simply allowing thermal radiation to pass efficiently through a nanoporous fabric. This demonstration may make possible wearable technologies for personalized cooling and paves the way for energy savings by reduced use of air conditioning.

Tumors occupy environments where they actively interact with multiple cellular processes, signaling pathways, and homeostatic mechanisms, such as, according to a recent study by Masri et al. (1), circadian rhythms. Tumor-secreted molecular messengers (the secretome) can spread over a range of distances and have both short-range and systemic influences on normal tissues and organs (2). To highlight the systemic effects of the cancer secretome, the concept of tumor macroenvironment has been coined (3). Masri et al. took this macro approach to inquire how tumors affect circadian cycling in a distal organ not yet infiltrated by metastasis.

Others have argued that the cold events merely reflect the chaotic variability of the climate system and are becoming less likely under climate change. How can different atmospheric scientists come to such different conclusions from the same data?

By showing that a set of transcription factors could reprogram somatic cells to acquire a pluripotent stem cell state, they ushered in the era of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The discovery made it crystal clear that cell identity is much more malleable than previously thought, and provided an invaluable tool for disease-oriented and translational researchers, bridging reductionism with patient-derived relevance. Combined with other maturing technologies, most notably genome editing and three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems, iPSC technology has enabled investigation that was hitherto only possible in model organisms (2, 3).

Governments debated how they would have responded had it happened on their home soil, aviation authorities reconsidered security, emergency services reassessed practices, and parents hugged their children tighter. Those of us in other countries willed Americans to rise above the senseless brutality and steadfastly defy the insult with patriotism, empathy, unity, and resilience. What we did not expect was the tawdry infighting, discord, and bitter dispute that would come to surround the identification and memorialization of those who lost their lives that day.

We present observations by the Dawn spacecraft that reveal a heavily cratered surface, a heterogeneous crater distribution, and an apparent absence of large craters. The morphology of some impact craters is consistent with ice in the subsurface, which might have favored relaxation, yet large unrelaxed craters are also present. Numerous craters exhibit polygonal shapes, terraces, flowlike features, slumping, smooth deposits, and bright spots. Crater morphology and simple-to-complex crater transition diameters indicate that the crust of Ceres is neither purely icy nor rocky. By dating a smooth region associated with the Kerwan crater, we determined absolute model ages (AMAs) of 550 million and 720 million years, depending on the applied chronology model.

The dwarf planet is dominated by numerous craters, but other features are also common. Linear structures include both those associated with impact craters and those that do not appear to have any correlation to an impact event. Abundant lobate flows are identified, and numerous domical features are found at a range of scales. Features suggestive of near-surface ice, cryomagmatism, and cryovolcanism have been identified. Although spectroscopic analysis has currently detected surface water ice at only one location on Ceres, the identification of these potentially ice-related features suggests that there may be at least some ice in localized regions in the crust.

In the cold outer solar system, volcanism can occur on solid bodies with a water-ice shell, but derived cryovolcanic constructs have proved elusive. We report the discovery, using Dawn Framing Camera images, of a landform on dwarf planet Ceres that we argue represents a viscous cryovolcanic dome. Parent material of the cryomagma is a mixture of secondary minerals, including salts and water ice. Absolute model ages from impact craters reveal that extrusion of the dome has occurred recently. Ceres evolution must have been able to sustain recent interior activity and associated surface expressions. We propose salts with low eutectic temperatures and thermal conductivities as key drivers for Ceres long-term internal evolution.

We used the spectrometer onboard the Dawn spacecraft to map their spatial distribution on the basis of diagnostic absorption features in the visible and near-infrared spectral range (0.25 to 5.0 micrometers). We found that magnesium- and ammonium-bearing minerals are ubiquitous across the surface. Variations in the strength of the absorption features are spatially correlated and indicate considerable variability in the relative abundance of the phyllosilicates, although their composition is fairly uniform. These data, along with the distinctive spectral properties of Ceres relative to other asteroids and carbonaceous meteorites, indicate that the phyllosilicates were formed endogenously by a globally widespread and extensive alteration process.

Theories predict a water ice-rich mantle, and water vapor emissions have been observed, yet no water (H2O) has been previously identified. The Visible and InfraRed (VIR) mapping spectrometer onboard the Dawn spacecraft has now detected water absorption features within a low-illumination, highly reflective zone in Oxo, a 10-kilometer, geologically fresh crater, on five occasions over a period of 1 month. Candidate materials are H2O ice and mineral hydrates. Exposed H2O ice would become optically undetectable within tens of years under current Ceres temperatures; consequently, only a relatively recent exposure or formation of H2O would explain Dawns findings. Some mineral hydrates are stable on geological time scales, but their formation would imply extended contact with ice or liquid H2O.

Parts of Ceres surface are heavily cratered, but the largest expected craters are absent. Ceres appears gravitationally relaxed at only the longest wavelengths, implying a mechanically strong lithosphere with a weaker deep interior. Ceres dry exterior displays hydroxylated silicates, including ammoniated clays of endogenous origin. The possibility of abundant volatiles at depth is supported by geomorphologic features such as flat crater floors with pits, lobate flows of materials, and a singular mountain that appears to be an extrusive cryovolcanic dome. On one occasion, Ceres temporarily interacted with the solar wind, producing a bow shock accelerating electrons to energies of tens of kilovolts.

This catalyst has demonstrated specific activity at 10 milliamps per square centimeter of oxide catalyst (OER current normalized to catalyst surface area), with only 270 to 290 millivolts of overpotential for 30 hours of continuous testing in acidic electrolyte. Density functional theory calculations suggest the formation of highly active surface layers during strontium leaching with IrO3 or anatase IrO2 motifs. The IrOx/SrIrO3 catalyst outperforms known IrOx and ruthenium oxide (RuOx) systems, the only other OER catalysts that have reasonable activity in acidic electrolyte.

Here, we report a copper-catalyzed radical relay pathway for enantioselective conversion of benzylic CH bonds into benzylic nitriles. Hydrogen-atom abstraction affords an achiral benzylic radical that undergoes asymmetric C(sp3)CN bond formation upon reaction with a chiral copper catalyst. The reactions proceed efficiently at room temperature with the benzylic substrate as limiting reagent, exhibit broad substrate scope with high enantioselectivity (typically 90 to 99% enantiomeric excess), and afford products that are key precursors to important bioactive molecules. Mechanistic studies provide evidence for diffusible organic radicals and highlight the difference between these reactions and CH oxidations mediated by enzymes and other catalysts that operate via radical rebound pathways.

We processed the material to develop a textile that promotes effective radiative cooling while still having sufficient air permeability, water-wicking rate, and mechanical strength for wearability. We developed a device to simulate skin temperature that shows temperatures 2.7 and 2.0C lower when covered with nanoPE cloth and with processed nanoPE cloth, respectively, than when covered with cotton. Our processed nanoPE is an effective and scalable textile for personal thermal management.

We apply these palladium complexes to catalytic enantioselective functionalization of -methylene CH bonds in aliphatic amides. Using bidentate ligands to accelerate CH activation of otherwise unreactive monodentate substrates is crucial for outcompeting the background reaction driven by substrate-directed cyclopalladation, thereby avoiding erosion of enantioselectivity. The potential of ligand acceleration in CH activation is also demonstrated by enantioselective -CH arylation of simple carboxylic acids without installing directing groups.

Cytokinins are mobile signals that are perceived by subsets of plant cells. We found that the responses to cytokinin signaling during Arabidopsis development are constrained by the transporter PURINE PERMEASE 14 (PUP14). In our experiments, the expression of PUP14 was inversely correlated to the cytokinin signaling readout. Loss of PUP14 function allowed ectopic cytokinin signaling accompanied by aberrant morphogenesis in embryos, roots, and the shoot apical meristem. PUP14 protein localized to the plasma membrane and imported bioactive cytokinins, thus depleting apoplastic cytokinin pools and inhibiting perception by plasma membranelocalized cytokinin sensors to create a sink for active ligands. We propose that the spatiotemporal cytokinin sink patterns established by PUP14 determine the cytokinin signaling landscape that shapes the morphogenesis of land plants.

The evolution of this capacity can be best investigated by comparative studies. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we explored whether and how dog brains segregate and integrate lexical and intonational information. We found a left-hemisphere bias for processing meaningful words, independently of intonation; a right auditory brain region for distinguishing intonationally marked and unmarked words; and increased activity in primary reward regions only when both lexical and intonational information were consistent with praise. Neural mechanisms to separately analyze and integrate word meaning and intonation in dogs suggest that this capacity can evolve in the absence of language.

We propose that this live attenuated vaccine acts like a silent natural infection in priming or boosting host immunity. A transmission dynamic model incorporating this hypothesis fits recent clinical trial data well and predicts that vaccine effectiveness depends strongly on the age group vaccinated and local transmission intensity. Vaccination in low-transmission settings may increase the incidence of more severe secondary-like infection and, thus, the numbers hospitalized for dengue. In moderate transmission settings, we predict positive impacts overall but increased risks of hospitalization with dengue disease for individuals who are vaccinated when seronegative. However, in high-transmission settings, vaccination benefits both the whole population and seronegative recipients. Our analysis can help inform policy-makers evaluating this and other candidate dengue vaccines.

We studied the local mechanisms that regulate the formation and distribution of synapses. We found that local -aminobutyric acid (GABA) release on dendrites of mouse cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons could induce gephyrin puncta and dendritic spine formation via GABA type A receptor activation and voltage-gated calcium channels during early postnatal development. Furthermore, the newly formed inhibitory and excitatory synaptic structures rapidly gained functions. Bidirectional manipulation of GABA release from somatostatin-positive interneurons increased and decreased the number of gephyrin puncta and dendritic spines, respectively. These results highlight a noncanonical function of GABA as a local synaptogenic element shaping the early establishment of neuronal circuitry in mouse cortex.

K+ ions permeate in single file through the selectivity filter, a narrow pore lined by backbone carbonyls that compose four K+ binding sites. Here, we report on the two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectra of a semisynthetic KcsA channel with site-specific heavy (13C18O) isotope labels in the selectivity filter. The ultrafast time resolution of 2D IR spectroscopy provides an instantaneous snapshot of the multi-ion configurations and structural distributions that occur spontaneously in the filter. Two elongated features are resolved, revealing the statistical weighting of two structural conformations. The spectra are reproduced by molecular dynamics simulations of structures with water separating two K+ ions in the binding sites, ruling out configurations with ions occupying adjacent sites.

However, the site of antibody interception of virus and the mechanism of antibody-mediated protection remain unclear. We administered a fully protective dose of the bNAb PGT121 to rhesus monkeys and challenged them intravaginally with SHIV-SF162P3. In PGT121-treated animals, we detected low levels of viral RNA and viral DNA in distal tissues for seven days following challenge. Viral RNApositive tissues showed transcriptomic changes indicative of innate immune activation, and cells from these tissues initiated infection after adoptive transfer into nave hosts. These data demonstrate that bNAb-mediated protection against a mucosal virus challenge can involve clearance of infectious virus in distal tissues.

She also performed a thorough inspection of the walls and found no moisture. The crew also replaced all of the BEAM sensor extended life battery packs. The MAS and SSK samples as well as the RAM dosimeters will be packed for return on 46S and analyzed in Houston. Cardio Ox and Biochem Profile Collections: Rubins and FE-5 Onishi performed their Flight Day 60 (FD60) urine and blood collections and inserted them into Minus Eighty Degree Celsius Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI). The Biochemical Profile experiment tests blood and urine samples obtained from astronauts before, during, and after spaceflight. Specific proteins and chemicals in the samples are used as biomarkers, or indicators of health. Post-flight analysis yields a database of samples and test results, which scientists can use to study the effects of spaceflight on the body. The goal of Cardio Ox is to determine whether biological markers of oxidative and inflammatory stress are elevated during and after space flight and whether this results in an increased, long-term risk of atherosclerosis risk in astronauts. Marrow: Rubins collected breath and ambient air samples in support of the Canadian Space Agencys Marrow experiment. Marrow investigation looks at the effect of microgravity on the bone marrow. It is believed that microgravity, like long-duration bed rest on Earth, has a negative effect on the bone marrow and the blood cells that are produced in the marrow. The extent of this effect, and its recovery, are of interest to space research and healthcare providers on Earth. ISS Change of Command (COC): The entire crew discussed with Mission Control Center (MCC)-Houston and MCC-Moscow flight control teams their roles and responsibilities for the timeframe between the COC event and departure of 46S. Anatoly Ivanishin then assumed command of the ISS from Jeff Williams. Following the COC, the 47S crew became prime for emergency response. Post Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Tasks: The crew deconfigured the Airlock following last weeks EVA operations and prepared Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs) and equipment for long term stowage. They also performed EMU cooling loop maintenance on the EMUs used during the EVA (3003 and 3008). Crew Quarters (CQ) Port Cleaning: In preparation for his departure from the ISS tomorrow Williams cleaned his CQ, including the intake and exhaust ducts, fans and airflow sensors. All activities were completed unless otherwise noted.

They completed their post-EVA medical checkups, and performed an Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) Water Recharge procedure on EMUs 3003 and 3008. The EMUs and associated equipment were then be prepared for storage. They then participated in an EVA debrief to discuss any comments regarding preparation and execution of the EVA. Skin-B Operations: The Skin-B investigation was conducted as FE-6 performed Corneometer, Tewameter and Visioscan measurements on his forearm. The Corneometer measures the hydration level of the stratus coreum (outer layer of the skin), the Tewameter measures the skin barrier function, and the Visioscan measures the skin surface topography. Skin B is a European Space Agency (ESA) investigation that aims to improve the understanding of skin aging, which is greatly accelerated in space. The data will also be used to verify the results from previous testing for the SkinCare investigation on the ISS. Space Headaches: The crew completed the ESA Space Headaches questionnaire which provides information that may help in the development of methods to alleviate associated symptoms and improvement in the well-being and performance of crew members in space. Headaches during space flight can negatively affect mental and physical capacities of crew members which can influence performance during a space mission. Habitability Walk-through: The crew recorded a walk-through video documenting observations of life onboard ISS, providing insight related to human factors and habitability. The Habitability investigation collects observations about the relationship between crew members and their environment on the ISS. Observations can help spacecraft designers understand how much habitable volume is required, and whether a missions duration impacts how much space crew members need.

While Williams and Rubin were outside, FE-5 Onishi operated the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) and assisted with the tasks. The EVA duration was 6 hours, 48 minutes. Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations for EVA: Today Robotics Ground Controllers powered up the MSS to support the TTCR EVA. Once the EVA crew completed the TTCR retract, FE-5 maneuvered the SSRMS into position to install an Articulating Portable Foot Restraint (APFR) on the SSRMS Latching End Effector (LEE). CDR ingressed the APFR, and the SSRMS was maneuvered to allow CDR to change the light of the CP9 (P1 Lower Outboard (LOOB)) camera then again to position CDR to install an External High Definition Camera (EHDC) on the CP9 camera. Once the CP9 tasks had been completed, the SSRMS was maneuvered to position CDR to install an EHDC on the CP8 (P1 Upper Outboard (UPOB)) camera. Once this had been completed, the SSRMS was moved to a park position. MSS performance today was nominal. Todays Planned Activities All activities were completed unless otherwise noted.

This afternoon the crew performed a conference with EVA ground specialist to discuss any final question about tomorrows TTCR EVA. The crew also prepared the Equipment Lock, EMUs and ancillary hardware to support EVA prep activities. Crew egress of the Airlock is scheduled for 7:10 am CDT. Multi-Omics sample collections: Flight Engineer-5 collected samples for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Multi-Omics experiment. Samples were then placed into the Minus Eighty Degree Celsius Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI). The Multi-omics analysis of human microbial-metabolic cross-talk in the space ecosystem (Multi-Omics) investigation evaluates the impacts of space environment and prebiotics on astronauts immune function, by combining the data obtained from the measurements of changes in the gut microbiological composition, metabolites profiles, and the immune system. Biomarkers for immune dysfunction during the crewmembers time on the ISS could be useful for the health management of astronauts. Habitability walkthrough: The Commander performed his sixth and final Habitability walkthrough video. Williams has been requested to focus on the windows available to the crew on the ISS, and their impact on habitability and productivity. The Habitability investigation results will be used to assess the relationship between crew members and their environment in order to better prepare for future long-duration spaceflights. Observations recorded during 6 month and 1 year missions can help spacecraft designers determine how much habitable volume is required, and whether a missions duration impacts how much space crew members need. Fine Motor Skills (FMS): Flight Engineer-5 completed his 9th of 20 sessions of FMS. Performing a series of interactive tasks on a touchscreen tablet were completed for the Fine Motor Skills investigation. This investigation is critical during long-duration space missions, particularly those skills needed to interact with technologies required in next-generation space vehicles, spacesuits, and habitats. The crewmembers fine motor skills are also necessary for performing tasks in transit or on a planetary surface, such as information access, just-in-time training, subsystem maintenance, and medical treatment. Circadian Rhythms: After 36 hours of wear-time, Flight Engineer-5 doffed the Double Sensors and Thermolab Control Unit and stowed the equipment. The objective of the experiment is to get a better understanding of any alterations in circadian rhythms in humans during long-term space flights. Such knowledge will not only provide important insights into the adaptations of the human autonomic nervous system in space over time, but also has significant practical implications by helping to improve physical exercise, rest- and work shifts as well as fostering adequate workplace illumination in the sense of occupational healthcare in future space missions.

The goal of the Cardio Ox investigation is to determine whether biological markers of oxidative and inflammatory stress are elevated during and after space flight and whether this results in an increased, long-term risk of atherosclerosis risk in astronauts. Twelve crewmembers provide blood and urine samples to assess biomarkers before launch, 15 and 60 days after launch, 15 days before returning to Earth, and within days after landing. Ultrasound scans of the carotid and brachial arteries are obtained at the same time points, as well as through 5 years after landing, as an indicator of cardiovascular health. Dose Tracker: The crew completed entries for medication tracking on an iPad today. This investigation documents the medication usage of crewmembers before and during their missions by capturing data regarding medication use during spaceflight, including side effect qualities, frequencies and severities. The data is expected to either support or counter anecdotal evidence of medication ineffectiveness during flight and unusual side effects experienced during flight. It is also expected that specific, near-real-time questioning about symptom relief and side effects will provide the data required to establish whether spaceflight-associated alterations in pharmacokinetics (PK) or pharmacodynamics (PD) is occurring during missions. Fine Motor Skills: A series of interactive tasks were completed for the Fine Motor Skills investigation. This investigation is critical during long-duration space missions, particularly those skills needed to interact with technologies required in next-generation space vehicles, spacesuits, and habitats. The crewmembers fine motor skills are also necessary for performing tasks in transit or on a planetary surface, such as information access, just-in-time training, subsystem maintenance, and medical treatment. Habitability Human Factors Directed Observations: The crew recorded and submitted a walk-through video documenting observations of life onboard ISS, providing insight related to human factors and habitability. The Habitability investigation collects observations about the relationship between crew members and their environment on the ISS. Observations can help spacecraft designers understand how much habitable volume is required, and whether a missions duration impacts how much space crew members need. Trailing Thermal Control Radiator (TTCR) Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparations: The EV crew continued the EVA tool configuration in preparation for the TTCR EVA on Thursday. The IV crew accessed the Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics (DOUG) software and completed additional robotics reviews of Space Station Remote Manipulator System support plan for the EVA. External Television Camera Group (ETVCG) Troubleshooting: The crew performed a procedure to verify that the heaters on the spare ETVCG Light are functional. They utilized the two jumpers that were built from pin kit materials and tested the ETVCG light and heaters. After the troubleshooting, the crew confirmed a functional camera light and heater circuit on the ETVCG. This light will be used to replace the degraded light at the P1 Lower Outboard location during Thursdays TTCR EVA. Todays Planned Activities All activities completed unless otherwise noted.

The Biomolecule Sequencer investigation seeks to demonstrate for the first time that DNA sequencing is feasible in an orbiting spacecraft. A space-based DNA sequencer could identify microbes, diagnose diseases and understand crew member health, and potentially help detect DNA-based life elsewhere in the solar system. Marrow Blood, Breath, and Ambient Air Sample Collection: Over the weekend the crew set up the Marrow air sample collection hardware in the crew quarters and today upon waking the crew took breath and ambient air samples to measure carbon monoxide concentration for the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) Marrow experiment. Marrow investigates the effect of microgravity on human bone marrow. It is believed that microgravity, like long-duration bed rest on Earth, has a negative effect on bone marrow and the blood cells that are produced in the marrow. The extent of this effect and its recovery are of interest to space research and healthcare providers on Earth. Human Research Program (HRP) Generic Urine and Frozen Blood Collection Double Spin: The crew continued HRP operations that began over the weekend by collecting saliva and urine samples for 24-hours and processing a set of blood samples for double spin operations using the Refrigerated Centrifuge. The samples were stowed in the Minus Eighty-degree Freezer for ISS MELFI. Mouse Epigenetics Closeout and Reconfiguration Operations: The crew performed Mouse Epigenetics closeout and reconfiguration activities to clean up and disassemble the Glove Box before removing the Mouse Habitat Cage Unit from the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF). The crew also changed the CBEF video output cable configuration from multiple channel cable to single channel cable and disconnect the CBEF Multiple Video Cable between CBEF and Image Processing Unit (IPU) as well as the CBEF and Video compression and Recording Unit 2 (VRU2) on Multi-purpose Small PayloadRack2 (MSPR2). Thermolab Instrumentation for Circadian Rhythms: The crew began the first of a three-day European Space Agency (ESA) Circadian Rhythms experiment by performing instrumentation with the Thermolab Double sensors, mounting the Thermolab Unit in the belt, connecting and powering on the Thermolab Unit before beginning a 36 hour continuous measurement. After the measurement was completed, the data was transferred and hardware stowed. The objective of the experiment is to get a better understanding of alterations in circadian rhythms in humans during long-term space flights. Such knowledge will not only provide important insights into the adaptations of the human autonomic nervous system in space over time, but also has significant practical implications by helping to improve physical exercise, rest and work shifts as well as fostering adequate workplace illumination in the sense of occupational healthcare in future space missions. Multi-Omics Operations: Today the crew supported the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Multi-Omics investigation by collecting body samples and inserting them into a Box Module in the Minus Eighty-degree Freezer for ISS (MELFI). The investigation evaluates the impacts of space environment and prebiotics on astronauts immune function by combining the data obtained from the measurements of changes in the microbiological composition, metabolites profiles, and the immune system. Habitability Human Factors Directed Observations: The crew will recorded and submited a walk-through video documenting observations of life onboard ISS, providing insight related to human factors and habitability. The Habitability investigation collects observations about the relationship between crew members and their environment on the ISS. Observations can help spacecraft designers understand how much habitable volume is required and whether a missions duration impacts how much space crew members need. Trailing Thermal Control Radiator (TTCR) Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparations: The Extravehicular (EV) crew conducted a review of procedures that cover the suit donning plan, pre-breathe protocol, Equipment Lock activities, egress and detailed EVA timeline. Following the review they participated in a conference with ground teams. The Intravehicular (IV) crew accessed the Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics (DOUG) software and completed a robotics review of Space Station Remote Manipulator System support plan for US EVA #37 this Thursday. External Television Camera Group (ETVCG) Troubleshooting Test Lead Build: The crew performed part 1 of a procedure to verify the heaters on the spare ETVCG Light are functional. They built two jumpers from pin kit materials for use in tomorrow&#8217;s task. Remote Power Control Module (RPCM) Remove &#38; Replace (R&#38;R): Over the weekend, Robotics Ground Controllers unstowed the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) from Mobile Base System (MBS) Power Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF)2. At the end of re-rigidizing the SPDM Latching End Effector (LEE) for SPDM unstow, the SPDM safed, which has been observed previously. Controllers performed the necessary recovery steps and released the SPDM LEE from MBS PDGF2. Once the SPDM had been unstowed, controllers maneuvered the SSRMS and SPDM to position SPDM Arm2 to use Robot Micro Conical Tool #2 (RMCT2) to demate and remove RPCM P12B_A from its slot which was previously attempted on June 14, 2016 without success. Today, after numerous pull and wiggle attempts, the RPCM came out of its slot. Both the RPCM and its slot were inspected and nothing was seen that would preclude pressing with stowing the RPCM in a spare slot and installing another RPCM in Slot P12B_A. This RPCM was then stowed in Spare Slot P13A_H. Controllers commanded the SPDM Arm 2 On-Orbit Replaceable Unit (ORU) Tool Change-out Mechanism (OTCM) handling the RMCT2 to release the Failed RPCM (removed from P12B_A slot) in the P13A_H slot. They then maneuvered the SSRMS and SPDM to position SPDM Arm2 to align RMCT2 with the spare RPCM located in P11A_D to demate and remove it from its slot. This RPCM was then moved to the P12B_A slot. It was successfully inserted and bolted to P12B_A worksite after being pushed with the maximum force allowed of 200 N. SPDM Arm 2 released the spare RPCM in P12B_A and ground teams confirmed it was functioning nominally. 46 Soyuz Survey: Following the RPCM R&#38;R, [&#8230;]</p></details></div><div><details><summary class='inner'><a href='https://blogs.nasa.gov/stationreport/2016/08/26/iss-daily-summary-report-08262016/' target='_blank'>ISS Daily Summary Report  08/26/2016</a></summary><p>SpaceX (SpX)-9 Release: Following the unberth of Dragon yesterday afternoon, the crew used the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) to release Dragon at 5:11 AM Central Time for its return to Earth. The Dragon capsule executed a de-orbit burn shortly after 10 AM Central Time, and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean approximately 45 minutes later. SpaceX-9 returned cargo and science samples which were processed onboard the ISS for analysis on the ground. Biological Rhythms 48 Holter and Actiwatch Removal and Data Save: Following two consecutive days of Biological Rhythms recording sessions, the crew removed the Digital Walk Holter Electrocardiogram (ECG) and the Actiwatch Spectrum and saved the collected data to the medical laptop. This concluded the Biological Rhythms experiment where two separate 24-hour Actiwatch measurements were performed to study the effects of long-term microgravity exposure on heart functions by analyzing an astronauts electrocardiogram for 48 hours. Biomolecule Sequencer Hardware Setup and Sample Initialization: The crew retrieved the Flow Cell and the Media Syringe Tube from Minus Eighty-degree Freezer for ISS (MELFI) before using the syringe to inject the sample into the Biomolecule Sequencer, which began the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing process. The Biomolecule Sequencer investigation seeks to demonstrate for the first time that DNA sequencing is feasible in an orbiting spacecraft. A space-based DNA sequencer could identify microbes, diagnose diseases and understand crew member health, and potentially help detect DNA-based life elsewhere in the solar system. Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) Manifold Bottle Replacement: The crew R&#38;Rd a CIR manifold bottle on one of the four CIR Manifolds in support of upcoming Flex 2 payload investigation activities. Fine Motor Skills: A series of interactive tasks on a touchscreen tablet were completed for the Fine Motor Skills investigation. This investigation is critical during long-duration space missions, particularly those skills needed to interact with technologies required in next-generation space vehicles, spacesuits, and habitats. The crewmembers fine motor skills are also necessary for performing tasks in transit or on a planetary surface, such as information access, just-in-time training, subsystem maintenance, and medical treatment. Space Headaches: The crew completed the European Space Agency (ESA) Space Headaches questionnaire which provides information that may help in the development of methods to alleviate associated symptoms and improvement in the well-being and performance of crew members in space. LS-1 Server Issues: Following the recent issues with the LS-1 server, the crew performed a laptop shell swap (motherboard, processor, memory) and retained only the hard drives. The LS-1 came back online without any issues. LAB RWS Monitor Display Issue: Prior to Dragon release, the SSRMS Lab Robotic Work Station (RWS) Monitor 1 was observed to be very dim, with the image shifted, and it seemed to be a negative image. The crew tried the brightness adjustment and checked the cables with no success. The video feed was moved from the degraded display Monitor 1 to a Monitor 3 which was operating nominally. The release and departure monitoring were completed nominally and on time. The LAB RWS Monitor 1 was later recovered by power cycling the Control Electronic Unit (CEU). The root cause is still under investigation. Todays Planned Activities All activities were completed unless otherwise noted. MORZE.

Space Automated Bioproduct Lab (SABL) CO2 Controller Removal: SABL-1s CO2 Incubator Controller was removed for return on SpaceX-9. SPHERES Blue Satellite: The CO2 tank in the SPHERES blue satellite was removed, vented, and packed. Meteor Hard Drive Retrieval: The Meteor Laptop hard drive was retrieved. Mouse Epigenetics Habitat Cage Unit Maintenance: The Mouse Cage Units containing the mice were transferred from the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF) to the glove box to conduct food cartridge exchanges and cleaning activities. The crew also performed troubleshooting activities on the Transportation Cage Units (TCU) by performing individual cover replacements, cage block replacements, and TCU exchanges to prepare for return on SpX-9. The Mouse Cage Units were then returned to CBEF. The Mouse Epigenetics investigation studies altered gene expression patterns in the organs of male mice that spend one month in space, and also examines changes in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of their offspring. Results from the investigation identify genetic alterations that happen after exposure to the microgravity environment of space. Biomolecule Sequencer Surface Pro 3 Hardware Checkout: The crew set up and connected Surface Pro 3 tablets to the wireless network before completing checkout activities to support upcoming Biomolecule Sequencer operations later this week. The Biomolecule Sequencer investigation seeks to demonstrate for the first time that DNA sequencing is feasible in an orbiting spacecraft. A space-based DNA sequencer could identify microbes, diagnose diseases and understand crew member health and potentially help detect DNA-based life elsewhere in the solar system. Fine Motor Skills: A series of interactive tasks on a touchscreen tablet was completed for the Fine Motor Skills investigation. This investigation is critical during long-duration space missions, particularly those skills needed to interact with technologies required in next-generation space vehicles, spacesuits, and habitats. The crewmembers fine motor skills are also necessary for performing tasks in transit or on a planetary surface, such as information access, just-in-time training, subsystem maintenance, and medical treatment. Habitability Human Factors Directed Observations: The crew recorded and submitted a walk-through video documenting observations of life onboard ISS, providing insight related to human factors and habitability. The Habitability investigation collects observations about the relationship between crew members and their environment on the ISS. Observations can help spacecraft designers understand how much habitable volume is required, and whether a missions duration impacts how much space crew members need. Dose Tracker: The crew completed entries for medication tracking on an iPad today. This investigation documents the medication usage of crewmembers before and during their missions by capturing data regarding medication use during spaceflight, including side effect qualities, frequencies and severities. The data is expected to either support or counter anecdotal evidence of medication ineffectiveness during flight and unusual side effects experienced during flight. It is also expected that specific, near-real-time questioning about symptom relief and side effects will provide the data required to establish whether spaceflight-associated alterations in pharmacokinetics (PK) or pharmacodynamics (PD) is occurring during missions. Columbus Payload Power Switching Box (PPSB) &#8211; SDX Switch 1 Reconfiguration: The crew reconfigured the SDX 1 switch on the PPSB1 for RapidScat in Columbus in preparation for tomorrows 63P reboost. Columbus Power Distribution Unit 1 (PDU-1) Troubleshooting: On Monday, ground teams were unable to repower the COLs PDU-1 Outlet 3 which provides operational power to RapidScat and Solar Monitoring Observatory (SOLAR) payloads. Today, ground teams successfully repowered SOLAR from Outlet 3 by turning OFF the Columbus Payload Power Switching Box (PPSB) &#8211; SDX switch 1 to isolate RapidScat from the power feed. RapidScat has active heater power and can remain deactivated with no impact to hardware. Ground teams continue to investigate the anomaly. Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations: Last night Robotics Ground Controllers stowed the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) on Mobile Base System (MBS) Power Data Grapple Fixture #2 (PDGF2). At the end of rigidizing its Latching End Effector (LEE) on MBS PDGF2, the SPDM safed, which has been observed previously. Controllers performed the necessary recovery steps and latched and mated the SPDM LEE to the PDGF. The SSRMS was then maneuvered to grapple the SpX-9 Flight Releasable Grapple Fixture (FRGF) in preparation of the SpX-9 release on Friday.
