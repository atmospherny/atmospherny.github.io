Mrk 1210 (a.k.a. UGC 4203, or the Phoenix galaxy).
</p>
<p>Methods. The source was observed by many X-ray facilities in the last 20
years. Here we present a NuSTAR observation and put the results in context of
previously published observations.
</p>
<p>Results. NuSTAR observed Mrk 1210 in 2012 for 15.4 ks. The source showed
Compton-thin obscuration similar to that observed by Chandra, Suzaku, BeppoSAX
and XMM-Newton over the past two decades, but different from the first
observation by ASCA in 1995, in which the active nucleus was caught in a low
flux state - or obscured by Compton-thick matter, with a reflection-dominated
spectrum. Thanks to the high-quality hard X-ray spectrum obtained with NuSTAR
and exploiting the long-term spectral coverage spanning 16.9 years, we can
precisely disentangle the transmission and reflection components and put
constraints on both the intrinsic long-term variability and hidden nucleus
scenarios. In the former case, the distance between the reflector and the
source must be at least ~ 2 pc, while in the latter one the eclipsing cloud may
be identified with a water maser-emitting clump.

as a function of their detection method and redshift. We analyze two separate
samples of galaxy clusters: a sample of 36 clusters at 0.35 &lt; z &lt; 0.9 selected
in the X-ray with the ROSAT PSPC 400 deg2 survey, and a sample of 90 clusters
at 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 1.2 selected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect with the
South Pole Telescope. Clusters from both samples have similar-quality Chandra
observations, which allow us to quantify their X-ray morphologies via two
distinct methods: centroid shifts and photon asymmetry. The latter technique
provides nearly unbiased morphology estimates for clusters spanning a broad
range of redshift and data quality. We further compare the X-ray morphologies
of X-ray- and SZ-selected clusters with those of simulated clusters. We do not
find a statistically significant difference in the measured X-ray morphology of
X-ray and SZ-selected clusters over the redshift range probed by these samples,
suggesting that the two are probing similar populations of clusters. We find
that the X-ray morphologies of simulated clusters are statistically
indistinguishable from those of X-ray- or SZ-selected clusters, implying that
the most important physics for dictating the large-scale gas morphology
(outside of the core) is well-approximated in these simulations. Finally, we
find no statistically significant redshift evolution in the X-ray morphology
(both for observed and simulated clusters), over the range z ~ 0.3 to z ~ 1,
seemingly in contradiction with the redshift-dependent halo merger rate
predicted by simulations.

of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to several key physical parameters of
supermassive black holes (SMBHs), focusing on BH spin ($a_{\star}$) at the high
BH-mass regime ($M_{BH} \geqslant10^9\, M_{\odot}$). We use a large grid of
model spectral energy distribution, assuming geometrically-thin,
optically-thick accretion discs, and spanning a wide range of five physical
parameters: BH mass $M_{BH}$, BH spin $a_{\star}$, Eddington ratio $L /
L_{Edd}$ , redshift $z$, and inclination angle $inc$. Based on the expected
fluxes in the SDSS imaging ugriz bands, we find that $\sim 99.8\%$ of our
models with $M_{BH} \leqslant 10^{9.5}\, M_{\odot}$ are selected as quasar
candidates and thus would have been targeted for spectroscopic follow-up.
However, in the extremely high-mass regime, $\geqslant 10^{10} M_{\odot}$, we
identify a bias against slowly/retrograde spinning SMBHs. The fraction of SEDs
that would have been selected as quasar candidates drops below $\sim50\%$ for
$a_{\star} &lt;0$ across $0.5&lt;z&lt;2$. For particularly massive BHs, with $M_{BH}
\simeq 3\times10^{10}\, M_{\odot}$, this rate drops below $\sim20\%$, and can
be yet lower for specific redshifts. We further find that the chances of
identifying any hypothetical sources with $M_{BH} = 10^{11}\, M_{\odot}$ by
colour selection would be extremely low at the level of $\sim 3\%$. Our
findings, along with several recent theoretical arguments and empirical
findings, demonstrate that the current understanding of the SMBH population at
the high-$M_{BH}$, and particularly the low- or retrograde-spinning regime, is
highly incomplete.

spectrum and bispectrum in canonical inflation with an arbitrary number of
light or heavy fields. Our method includes all relevant effects at tree-level
in the loop expansion, including (i) interference between growing and decaying
modes near horizon exit; (ii) correlation and coupling between species near
horizon exit and on superhorizon scales; (iii) contributions from mass terms;
and (iv) all contributions from coupling to gravity. We track the evolution of
each correlation function from the vacuum state through horizon exit and the
superhorizon regime, with no need to match quantum and classical parts of the
calculation; when integrated, our approach corresponds exactly with the
tree-level Schwinger or 'in-in' formulation of quantum field theory. In this
paper we give the equations necessary to evolve all two- and three-point
correlation functions together with suitable initial conditions. The final
formalism is suitable to compute the amplitude, shape, and scale dependence of
the bispectrum in models with |fNL| of order unity or less, which are a target
for future galaxy surveys such as Euclid, DESI and LSST. As an illustration we
apply our framework to a number of examples, obtaining quantitatively accurate
predictions for their bispectra for the first time. Two accompanying reports
describe publicly-available software packages that implement the method.

solve the evolution equations for the 2- and 3-point correlation functions (in
field space and for the curvature perturbation) for any inflationary model with
canonical kinetic terms. It makes no approximations beyond the applicability of
tree-level perturbation theory. Given an input Lagrangian, CppTransport
performs symbolic calculations to determine the 'Feynman rules' of the model

It includes a visualization suite that automates extraction of observable
quantities from the raw n-point functions and generates high quality plots with
minimal manual intervention. It is intended to be used as a collaborative
platform, promoting the rapid investigation of models and systematizing their
comparison with observation. This guide describes how to install and use the

F5V star HD~157587 obtained with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) that reveal the
debris disk as a bright ring structure at a separation of $\sim$80$-$100~AU.
The new GPI data complement recent HST/STIS observations that show the disk
extending out to over 500~AU. The GPI image displays a strong asymmetry along
the projected minor axis as well as a fainter asymmetry along the projected
major axis. We associate the minor and major axis asymmetries with polarized
forward scattering and a possible stellocentric offset, respectively. To
constrain the disk geometry we fit two separate disk models to the polarized
image, each using a different scattering phase function. Both models favor a
disk inclination of $\sim 70\degr$ and a $1.5\pm0.6$ AU stellar offset in the
plane of the sky along the projected major axis of the disk. We find that the
stellar offset in the disk plane, perpendicular to the projected major axis is
degenerate with the form of the scattering phase function and remains poorly
constrained. The disk is not recovered in total intensity due in part to strong
adaptive optics residuals, but we recover three point sources. Considering the
system's proximity to the galactic plane and the point sources' positions
relative to the disk, we consider it likely that they are background objects
and unrelated to the disk's offset from the star.

untested in imaging the host galaxies of damped Lyman alpha (DLA) systems. In
this pilot study, we present the first application of ADI to directly imaging
the host galaxy of the DLA seen towards the quasar J1431+3952. K-band imaging
of the field surrounding J1431+3952 was obtained on the Gemini North telescope
with the adaptive optics system and a laser guide star. We computed a
sensitivity curve that demonstrates the sensitivity of our observations as a
function of K-band magnitude, impact parameter and DLA angular size. For an
impact parameter of 0.5" (3.4 kpc at the redshift of the absorber) our mass
sensitivity is log (M_star/M_sun) ~ 9.2 and drops to ~ 9.0 at separations
beyond ~ 6 kpc for the smallest size model galaxy. Three candidate galaxies are
identified within 5". Stellar masses were computed from the K-band photometry
yielding values of log (M_star/M_sun) ~ 9.9, 9.7 and 11.1 respectively. The
likely identification of the absorbing galaxy is discussed, and we conclude
that the galaxy with the largest impact parameter and highest stellar mass is
unlikely to be the host, based on its inconsistency with the N(HI) impact
parameter relation and inconsistent photometric redshift. Whilst we cannot
distinguish between the remaining two candidates as the DLA host, we note that
despite the low spin temperature and relatively high metallicity of the DLA,
the host does not appear to be a particularly luminous (high mass) galaxy.

confusion limit of blank-field single-dish surveys ($S_{850} \lesssim$ 2 mJy)
are poorly constrained. Using a newly developed color selection technique,
Optical-Infrared Triple Color (OIRTC), that has been shown to successfully
{select} such faint SMGs, we identify a sample of 2938 OIRTC-selected galaxies,
dubbed Triple Color Galaxies (TCGs), in the UKIDSS-UDS field. We show that
these galaxies have a median 850 $\mu$m flux of S$_{850} = 0.96\pm0.04$ mJy
(equivalent to a star-formation rate SFR $\sim60-100$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ based
on SED fitting), representing the first large sample of faint SMGs that bridges
the gap between bright SMGs and normal star-forming galaxies in S$_{850}$ and
$L_{\rm IR}$. We assess the basic properties of TCGs and their relationship
with other galaxy populations at $z\sim2$. We measure the two-point
autocorrelation function for this population and derive a typical halo mass of
log$_{10}$(M$_{\rm halo}$) $=12.9^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$, $12.7^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$, and
$12.9^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ $h^{-1}$M$_\odot$ at $z=1-2$, $2-3$, and $3-5$,
respectively. Together with the bright SMGs (S$_{850} \gtrsim 2$ mJy) and a
comparison sample of less far-infrared luminous star-forming galaxies, we find
a lack of dependence between spatial clustering and S$_{850}$ (or SFR),
suggesting that the difference between these populations may lie in their local
galactic environment. Lastly, on the scale of $\sim8-17$ kpc at $1&lt;z&lt;5$ we find
a tentative enhancement of the clustering of TCGs over the comparison
star-forming galaxies, suggesting that some faint SMGs are physically
associated pairs, perhaps reflecting a merging origin in their triggering.

from the 246-fiber Mitchell integral-field spectrograph (IFS) at McDonald

(sigma), and higher-order non-Gaussian velocity features (Gauss-Hermite moments
h3 to h6). Our sample contains a high fraction (~80%) of slow and non-rotators

galaxy mass, reaching ~50% at MK ~ -25.5 mag and ~90% at MK ~ 26 mag. All of
our fast rotators show a clear anti-correlation between h3 and V/sigma, and the
slope of the anti-correlation is steeper in more round galaxies. The radial
profiles of sigma show a clear luminosity and environmental dependence: the 12
most luminous galaxies in our sample (MK &lt;~ -26 mag) are all brightest
cluster/group galaxies (except NGC 4874) and all have rising or nearly flat
sigma profiles, whereas five of the seven "isolated" galaxies are all fainter

have a range of values between 0 and 0.5. Most of our galaxies show positive
radial gradients in h4, and those galaxies also tend to have rising sigma

with magnetically driven disc winds and viscous heating. Methods: We consider
an initially massive disc with ~0.1 Msun to track the evolution from the early
stage of PPDs. We solve the time evolution of surface density and temperature
by taking into account viscous heating and the loss of the mass and the angular
momentum by the disc winds within the framework of a standard alpha model for
accretion discs. Our model parameters, turbulent viscosity, disc wind mass
loss, and disc wind torque, which are adopted from local magnetohydrodynamical
simulations and constrained by the global energetics of the gravitational
accretion, largely depends on the physical condition of PPDs, particularly on
the evolution of the vertical magnetic flux in weakly ionized PPDs. Results:
Although there are still uncertainties concerning the evolution of the vertical
magnetic flux remaining, surface densities show a large variety, depending on
the combination of these three parameters, some of which are very different
from the surface density expected from the standard accretion. When a PPD is in
a "wind-driven accretion" state with the preserved vertical magnetic field, the
radial dependence of the surface density can be positive in the inner region
&lt;1-10 au. The mass accretion rates are consistent with observations, even in
the very low level of magnetohydrodynamical turbulence. Such a positive radial
slope of the surface density gives a great impact on planet formation because
(i)it inhibits the inward drift or even results in the outward drift of
pebble/boulder-sized solid bodies, and (ii) it also makes the inward type-I
migration of proto-planets slower or even reversed. Conclusions: The variety of
our calculated PPDs should yield a wide variety of exoplanet systems.

Kinematic studies of large structures in GMCs toward these ring-like structures
may help us to understand how massive stars form. The origin and properties of
the ring-like structure G345.45+1.50 is investigated through observations of
the 13CO(3-2) line. The aim of the observations is to determine the kinematics
in the region and to compare physical characteristics estimated from gas
emission with those previously determined using dust continuum emission. The
13CO(3-2) line was mapped toward the whole ring using the APEX telescope. The
ring is found to be expanding with a velocity of 1.0 km/s, containing a total
mass of 6.9e3 Msun, which agrees well with that determined using 1.2 mm dust
continuum emission. An expansion timescale of 3e6 yr and a total energy of 7e46
erg are estimated. The origin of the ring might have been a supernova
explosion, since a 35.5 cm source, J165920-400424, is located at the center of
the ring without an infrared counterpart. The ring is fragmented, and 104
clumps were identified with diameters of between 0.3 and 1.6 pc, masses of
between 2.3 and 7.5e2 Msun, and densities of between 1.0e2 and 1.0e4 cm^-3. At
least 18% of the clumps are forming stars, as is shown in infrared images.
Assuming that the clumps can be modeled as Bonnor-Ebert spheres, 13 clumps are
collapsing, and the rest of them are in hydrostatic equilibrium with an

during the rise of its 2005 outburst. We detected two hard X-ray flares, the
first one during the transition from the soft state to the ultra-soft state,
and the second one in the ultra-soft state. The first X-ray flare coincided
with an optically thin radio flare. We also observed a hint of increased radio
emission during the second X-ray flare. To explain the hard flares without
invoking a secondary emission component, we fit the entire data set with the
eqpair model. This single, hybrid Comptonization model sufficiently fits the
data even during the hard X-ray flares if we allow reflection fractions greater
than unity. In this case, the hard X-ray flares correspond to a Comptonizing
corona dominated by non-thermal electrons. The fits also require absorption
features in the soft and ultra-soft state which are likely due to a wind. In
this work we show that the wind and the optically thin radio flare co-exist.
Finally, we have also investigated the radio to optical spectral energy
distribution, tracking the radio spectral evolution through the quenching of
the compact jet and rise of the optically thin flare, and interpreted all data
using state transition models.

to estimate this loss by debiasing a Fisher matrix as previously done, due to a
fundamental inequality that describes how biases arise in non-linear functions.
We therefore develop direct estimators for parameter credibility contours and
the figure of merit. We apply our results to DES Science Verification weak

credibility contours. No significant loss of information is found for KiDS. For
a Euclid-like survey, with about 10 nuisance parameters we find that 2900

with an additional uncertainty of about 2%. Without any nuisance parameters
1900 simulations are sufficient to only lose 1% of information. We also derive
an estimator for the Fisher matrix of the unknown true covariance matrix, two

Our
sample consists of WDs of DA and DC spectral types in the SDSS r magnitude
range from 13 to 17. We performed polarimetric observations with the RoboPol
polarimeter attached to the 1.3-m telescope at the Skinakas Observatory. We
have 74 WDs in our sample, of which almost all are low polarized WDs with
polarization degree (PD) smaller than 1%, while only 2 have PD higher than 1%.
There is an evidence that on average the isolated WDs of DC type have higher PD
(with median PD of 0.78%) than the isolated DA type WDs (with median PD of
0.36%). On the other hand, the median PD of isolated DA type WDs is almost the
same, i.e. 0.36% as the median PD of DA type white dwarfs in binary systems
with red dwarfs (dM type), i.e. 0.33%. This shows, as expected, that there is
no contribution to the PD from the companion if the WD companion is the red
dwarf, which is the most common situation for WDs binary systems. We do not
find differences in the polarization degree between magnetic and non-magnetic
WDs. Because 97% of WDs in our sample have PD lower than 1%, they can be used
as faint zero--polarized standard star in the magnitude range from 13 up to 17

right ascension and from -11 degrees to 78 degrees in declination.
Additionally, we found that for low extinction values (&lt; 0.04) the best model
that describes the dependence of PD on E(B-V) is given by the equation:
PD_{max, ISM}[%] = 0.65 x E(B-V)^{0.12}.

modeled disk-integrated solar RVs using surface velocities, limb darkening, and
information about convective blueshift from 3D magneto-hydrodynamic

solar RVs during eclipse. Our best model reproduced the observations to within
a relative precision of 10% with residuals less than 30 m s$^{-1}$. We
cross-checked parameterizations of velocity fields using a Dopplergram from the

Dopplergram does not provide correct information about convective blueshift
necessary for m s$^{-1}$ RV work. As main limitation for modeling RVs during
eclipses, we identified limited knowledge about convective blueshift and line
shape as functions of solar limb angle. We suspect that our model line profiles
are too shallow at limb angles larger than $\mu = 0.6$ resulting in incorrect
weighting of the velocities across the solar disk. Alternative explanations
cannot be excluded like suppression of convection in magnetic areas and
undiscovered systematics during eclipse observations. Accurate observations of

level of solar activity is studied. It is shown that the fraction of small
groups is not constant but decreases with the level of solar activity so that
high solar activity is largely defined by big groups. We study the possible
influence of solar activity on the ability of a realistic observer to see and
report the daily number of sunspot groups. It is shown that the relation
between the number of sunspot groups as seen by different observers with
different observational acuity thresholds is strongly non-linear and cannot be
approximated by the traditionally used linear scaling ($k-$factors). The
observational acuity threshold [$A_{\rm th}$] is considered to quantify the
quality of each observer, instead of the traditional relative $k-$factor. A
nonlinear $c-$factor based on $A_{\rm th}$ is proposed, which can be used to
correct each observer to the reference conditions. The method is tested on a
pair of principal solar observers, Wolf and Wolfer, and it is shown that the
traditional linear correction, with the constant $k-$factor of 1.66 to scale
Wolf to Wolfer, leads to an overestimate of solar activity around solar maxima.

conclude that of the 27 sources with sufficient information to classify, the
radio emission from one source is from star formation, 13 are flat-spectrum
radio quasars and 13 are steep-spectrum sources. We also argue that the
steep-spectrum sources are off-axis (unbeamed) radio sources with rest-frame

classified as gigahertz peaked-spectrum (GPS) and megahertz peaked-spectrum

primary interest when studying their rotational dynamics, internal mixing and
magnetic fields generation. In this context, helio- and asteroseismology probe
angular velocity gradients deep within solar type stars. Still the rotation of
the close center of such stars on the main sequence is hardly detectable and
the dynamical interactions of the radiative core with the surface convective
envelope is not well understood. Among them, the influence of the differential
rotation profile sustained by convection and applied as a boundary condition to
the radiation zone may be very important leading to the formation of
tachoclines. In the solar convective region, the equator is rotating faster
than the pole while numerical simulations predict either a solar or an
anti-solar rotation in other low mass stars envelopes depending on their
convective Rossby number. In this work, we therefore build for the first time
2D steady hydrodynamical models of low mass stars radiation zone providing a
full 2D description of their dynamics and studying the influence of a general

with their dominant type of energy. To this aim, relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of different jet models threaded by a helical
magnetic field have been analyzed covering a wide region in the magnetosonic
Mach number - specific internal energy plane. The merit of this plane is that
models dominated by different types of energy (internal energy: hot jets;
rest-mass energy: kinetically dominated jets; magnetic energy: Poynting-flux
dominated jets) occupy well separated regions. The analyzed models also cover a
wide range of magnetizations. Models dominated by the internal energy (i.e.,
hot models, or Poynting-flux dominated jets with magnetizations larger than but
close to 1) have a rich internal structure characterized by a series of
recollimation shocks and present the largest variations in the flow Lorentz
factor (and internal energy density). Conversely, in kinetically dominated
models there is not much internal nor magnetic energy to be converted into
kinetic one and the jets are featureless, with small variations in the flow
Lorentz factor. The presence of a significant toroidal magnetic field threading
the jet produces large gradients in the transversal profile of the internal
energy density. Poynting-flux dominated models with high magnetization (&gt;10)
are prone to be unstable against magnetic pinch modes, which sets limits to the
expected magnetization in parsec-scale AGN jets {and/or constrains their

activity on early Mars, but a consensus has yet to emerge regarding the
mechanism for producing it. One hypothesis suggests early Mars was warmed by a
thick greenhouse atmosphere. Another suggests that early Mars was generally
cold but was warmed occasionally by impacts or by episodes of enhanced
volcanism. These latter hypotheses struggle to produce the amounts of rainfall
needed to form the martian valleys, but are consistent with inferred low rates
of weathering compared to Earth. Here, we provide a geophysical mechanism that
could have induced cycles of glaciation and deglaciation on early Mars. Our
model produces dramatic climate cycles with extended periods of glaciation
punctuated by warm periods lasting up to 10 Myr, much longer than those
generated in other episodic warming models. The cycles occur because stellar
insolation was low, and because CO2 outgassing is not able to keep pace with
CO2 consumption by silicate weathering followed by deposition of carbonates.
While CO2 by itself is not able to deglaciate early Mars in our model, we
assume that the greenhouse effect is enhanced by substantial amounts of H2
outgassed from Mars' reduced crust and mantle. Our hypothesis can be tested by
future Mars exploration that better establishes the time scale for valley
formation.

they represent unified star-forming complexes with sizes of several hundred pc

of stars with very inhomogeneous ambient gas in the walls of the SGS. The
arguments supporting an idea about the triggering of star formation in SGS by
the HI supershells collision are presented. We also found a faint ionized

reconnection with overlying flux in the helical current sheet formed by the

LSS observables in the mildly non-linear regime. In this paper we focus on
biased tracers. We argue that in calculations at a given order in the dark

larger higher derivative biases. A natural prediction of the EFTofLSS is
therefore that by simply adding higher derivative biases, all tracers should
perform comparably well. We implement this prediction for the halo-halo and the

tidal field perturbing the horizon's geometry varies over a generic orbit, with
significant variations for eccentric orbits. Many of the features of the
horizon's behavior found previously carry over to the dynamical case in a
natural way. In particular, we find significant offsets between the applied

from the SDSS in large-scale cosmic voids on time scales of 10 Myr and 100 Myr,
using H$\alpha$ emission line strengths and GALEX FUV fluxes, respectively. The
first sample consists of 109,818 optically selected galaxies. We find that void
galaxies in this sample have higher specific star formation rates (SSFRs; star
formation rates per unit stellar mass) than similar stellar mass galaxies in
denser regions. The second sample is a subset of the optically selected sample
containing 8070 galaxies with reliable HI detections from ALFALFA. For the full
HI detected sample, SSFRs do not vary systematically with large-scale
environment. However, investigating only the HI detected dwarf galaxies reveals
a trend towards higher SSFRs in voids. Furthermore, we estimate the star
formation rate per unit HI mass (known as the star formation efficiency; SFE)
of a galaxy, as a function of environment. For the overall HI detected
population, we notice no environmental dependence. Limiting the sample to dwarf
galaxies again reveals a trend towards higher SFEs in voids. These results
suggest that void environments provide a nurturing environment for dwarf galaxy
evolution allowing for higher specific star formation rates and efficiencies.

sources for ground-based detectors, and gravitational waves from black
hole-neutron star mergers are expected to be detected in the next few years.
Simultaneous detection of electromagnetic counterparts with gravitational-wave
detection provides rich information about the merger events. Among the possible
electromagnetic counterparts from the black hole-neutron star merger, the
emission powered by the decay of radioactive r-process nuclei, so called
kilonova/macronova, is one of the best targets for follow-up observation. We
derive fitting formulas for the mass and the velocity of ejecta from a generic
black hole-neutron star merger based on recently performed numerical relativity
simulations. We combined these fitting formulas with a new semi-analytic model
for a black hole-neutron star kilonova/macronova lightcurve which reproduces
the results of radiation-transfer simulations. Specifically, the semi-analytic
model reproduces the result of each band magnitude obtained by the radiation
transfer simulations within ~1 mag. By using this semi-analytic model, we found
that, at 400 Mpc, the kilonova/macronova is as bright as 22-24 mag for the
cases with a small chirp mass and a high black hole spin, and &gt;28 mag for a
large chirp mass and a low black hole spin. We also apply our model to
GRB130603B as an illustration, and show that a black hole-neutron star merger
with a rapidly spinning black hole and a large neutron star radius is favored.

very slow and/or symbiotic novae. In this first in a series of papers we
present the M87 nova finder charts, and the light and color curves of the

novae are uncorrelated with each other and with position in the galaxy. The
spatial distribution of the M87 novae follows the light of the galaxy,
suggesting that novae accreted by M87 during cannibalistic episodes are
well-mixed. Conservatively using only the 32 brightest classical novae we
derive a nova rate for M87: $363_{-45}^{+33}$ novae/yr. We also derive the
luminosity-specific classical nova rate for this galaxy, which is
$7.88_{-2.6}^{+2.3} /yr/ 10^{10}L_\odot,_{K}$. Both rates are 3-4 times higher
higher than those reported for M87 in the past, and similarly higher than those
reported for all other galaxies. We suggest that most previous ground-based
surveys for novae in external galaxies, including M87, miss most faint, fast

exploration that have shown the incredible spirit of the human drive to explore
and understand our universe. Yet in those 60 years we have barely left our
solar system with the Voyager 1 spacecraft launched in 1977 finally leaving the
solar system after 37 years of flight at a speed of 17 km/s or less than 0.006%
the speed of light. As remarkable as this is we will never reach even the
nearest stars with our current propulsion technology in even 10 millennium. We
have to radically rethink our strategy or give up our dreams of reaching the
stars, or wait for technology that does not currently exist. While we all dream
of human spaceflight to the stars in a way romanticized in books and movies, it
is not within our power to do so, nor it is clear that this is the path we
should choose. We posit a technological path forward, that while not simple, it
is within our technological reach. We propose a roadmap to a program that will
lead to sending relativistic probes to the nearest stars and will open up a
vast array of possibilities of flight both within our solar system and far
beyond. Spacecraft from gram level complete spacecraft on a wafer ("wafersats")
that reach more than 1/4 c and reach the nearest star in 20 years to spacecraft
with masses more than 10^5 kg (100 tons) that can reach speeds of greater than
1000 km/s. These systems can be propelled to speeds currently unimaginable with
existing propulsion technologies. To do so requires a fundamental change in our
thinking of both propulsion and in many cases what a spacecraft is. In addition
to larger spacecraft, some capable of transporting humans, we consider
functional spacecraft on a wafer, including integrated optical communications,
imaging systems, photon thrusters, power and sensors combined with directed

in the intracluster medium (ICM) of Coma cluster observed with ${\it Planck}$.
The SZ data links the maximum observable X-ray scale to the large Mpc scale,
extending our knowledge of the power spectrum of ICM fluctuations. Deprojecting
the 2-d SZ perturbations into 3-d pressure fluctuations, we find an amplitude
spectrum which peaks at $\delta P/P = 33\pm 12\%$ and $74\pm19\%$ in the $15'$
and $40'$ radius region, respectively. We perform tests to ensure fluctuations
are intrinsic to the cluster and not due to noise contamination. By using
high-resolution hydrodynamical models, we improve the ICM turbulence
constraints in Coma, finding 3-d Mach number ${\rm Ma_{3d}}= 0.8\pm0.3$ (15'
region), increasing to supersonic values at larger radii (40'), and an
injection scale $L_{\rm inj}\approx 500$ kpc. Such properties are consistent
with driving due to mergers, in particular tied to internal galaxy groups. The
large pressure fluctuations show that Coma is in adiabatic mode (mediated by
sound waves), rather than isobaric mode (mediated by buoyancy waves). As
predicted by turbulence models, the distribution of SZ fluctuations is
log-normal with mild non-Gaussianities (heavy tails). The substantial
non-thermal pressure support implies hydrostatic mass bias $b_M=-15\%$ to
$-45\%$ from the core to the outskirt region, respectively. While total SZ
power probes the thermal energy content, the SZ fluctuations constrain the
non-thermal deviations important for precision cosmology. The proposed, novel
approach can be exploited by multifrequency observations using ground based
interferometers and future space CMB missions.

the search threshold, and passing grade on three statistical transit
consistency tests. Light curves for which a transit signal is identified are
iteratively searched for additional signatures after a limb-darkened transiting

There was a strategic emphasis on completeness over reliability for the final

produced the first disk-integrated solar phase curve of a typical KBO from

derive a CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor by several methods including a new
method that uses simple photodissocation models and resolved CO line intensity
measurements to derive a relationship that uniquely predicts $\alpha_{CO}$ for
a given metallicity. We find that the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor is 4 to 35
times that of the Milky Way (18.1 to 150.5 M$_\odot$ / (K km/s pc$^2$)). The
star formation efficiency of the molecular gas at least 10 times higher than
that found in normal spiral galaxies, which is likely due to the
burst-dominated star formation history of II Zw 40 rather than an intrinsically
higher efficiency. The molecular clouds within II Zw 40 resemble those in other
strongly interacting systems like the Antennae: overall they have high
size-linewidth coefficients and molecular gas surface densities. These
properties appear to be due to the high molecular gas surface densities
produced in this merging system rather than to increased external pressure.
Overall, these results paint a picture of II Zw 40 as a complex, rapidly

nucleosynthesis. The amount of heavy r-process material is consistent with the
mass ejection and rates of mergers, and abundances of relic radioactive
materials suggest that heavy r-process material is produced in rare events.
Observations of possible macronovae provide further support for this model.
Still, some concerns remain. One is the observation of heavy r-process elements
in Ultra Faint Dwarf (UFD) galaxies. The escape velocities from UFDs are so
small that the natal kicks, taking place at neutron stars birth, might eject
such binaries from UFDs. Furthermore the old stellar populations of UFDs
requires that r-process nucleosynthesis must have taken place very early on,
while it may take several Gyr for compact binaries to merge. This last problem
arises also within the Milky Way where heavy r-process materials has been
observed in some low metallicity stars. We show here that since a significant
fraction of neutron star binaries form with a very small proper motion those
won't be ejected even from a UFD. Furthermore, a significant fraction of these
binaries merge within a few hundred Myr and in some cases the merger time is
even shorter than a hundred Myr. This population of "rapid mergers" explains
the appearance of heavy r-process material in both UFDs and in the Milky Way.

Finally, we find that the longitude of perihelion is significantly correlated

This correlation is further evidence of an unknown massive planet on an

of the sky (180 degree longitude of perihelion differences) would have their
closest approaches to the eccentric planet at opposite points in their orbits,
thus making the extreme objects prefer to stay away from opposite ecliptic

Instead they are anisotropic elongated cigar- or bar-like structures, similar
to the prolate dwarf spheroidal galaxy population of the Local Group. The
intrinsic distribution of axial ratios of the Coma UDGs is flat in the range of
0.4 &lt;= a/c &lt;= 0.9 which will provide important constraints for theoretical

The resulting photon beam passes through a 15 cm liquid hydrogen target,

or through a resonant process in the $s$- and $u$-channel. The decay $e^+e^-$

production of the charmed 5-quark resonance dominates the $t$-distribution at

sufficient to observe a clear resonance enhancement in the total cross section

$Z$-boson to the nucleon. In the Standard Model and at tree level, the weak
charge of the proton is related to the weak mixing angle and accidentally
suppressed, $Q_W^{p,\,{\rm tree}}=1-4\sin^2\theta_W\approx0.07$. Modern
experiments aim at extracting $Q_W^p$ at $\sim1\%$ accuracy. Similarly, parity
non-conservation in atoms allows to access the weak charge of atomic nuclei. We
consider a novel class of radiative corrections, an exchange of two photons
with parity violation in the hadronic/nuclear system. These corrections may
affect the extraction of $\sin^2\theta_W$ from the experimental data at the
relevant level of precision because they are affected by long-range
interactions similar to other parity-violating radiative corrections, such as,
e.g., the $\gamma Z$-exchange, which has obtained much attention recently. We
show that the significance of this new correction increases with the beam

As a result, both the resonance energy and width increase with the plasma

gives small overbound of about 3 MeV for 16O, and this is improved by slightly
modifying three-body Majorana exchange parameter. Also, the coupling with the

semi-classical and time-frequency analysis. These two different areas combined
together provide interesting outcomes in terms of Schr\"odinger type equations.
Indeed, continuity results of both Schr\"odinger propagators and their
asymptotic solutions are obtained on $\hbar$-dependent Banach spaces, the
semi-classical version of the well-known modulation spaces. Moreover, their
operator norm is controlled by a constant independent of the Planck's constant
$\hbar$. The main tool in our investigation is the joint application of
standard approximation techniques from semi-classical analysis and a
generalized version of Gabor frames, dependent of the parameter $\hbar$.
Continuity properties of more general Fourier integral operators (FIOs) and
their sparsity are also investigated.

the atom-photon interaction in the dissipation process. In the bad-cavity limit

atom-atom coherence alternates with signs, showing critical transitions
alternatively in SL operations. This suggests a complexity of the collective
effect emerging in a large ensemble of atoms. Therefore this effect in a SL can
not be simply interpreted by only a part of the whole ensemble. We numerically
solve for a steady state SL including the spatially-dependent LRDDI, and locate
the maximal cavity photon number and the minimal spectral linewidth
respectively at the optimal atomic separations in the setting of an equidistant

scheme, we discuss both the resonant and large-detuning conditions, and show
that the entanglement of two mechanical oscillators can be achieved with the
assistance of a two-level atom and cavity-radiation pressure. In the resonant
case, the operation time is relatively short, which is desirable to minimize
the effects of decoherence. While in the large-detuning case, the cavity is
only virtually excited during the interaction. Therefore, the decay of the
cavity is effectively suppressed, which makes the efficient decoherence time of
the cavity to be greatly prolonged. Thus, we observe that this virtual-photon

deterministic and no measurements on the atom and the cavity are required.
These are experimentally important. Finally, the decoherence effect and the

distribution on observed variables is compatible with some causal structure.
The difficult case is when the structure includes latent variables. We here
introduce the inflation technique for tackling this problem. An inflation of a
causal structure is a new causal structure that can contain multiple copies of
each of the original variables, but where the ancestry of each copy mirrors
that of the original. For every distribution compatible with the original
causal structure we identify a corresponding family of distributions, over
certain subsets of inflation variables, which is compatible with the inflation
structure. It follows that compatibility constraints at the inflation level can
be translated to compatibility constraints at the level of the original causal
structure; even if the former are weak, such as observable statistical
independences implied by disjoint causal ancestry, the translated constraints
can be strong. In particular, we can derive inequalities whose violation by a
distribution witnesses that distribution's incompatibility with the causal
structure (of which Bell inequalities and Pearl's instrumental inequality are
prominent examples). We describe an algorithm for deriving all of the
inequalities for the original causal structure that follow from ancestral
independences in the inflation. Applied to an inflation of the Triangle
scenario with binary variables, it yields inequalities that are stronger in at
least some aspects than those obtainable by existing methods. We also describe
an algorithm that derives a weaker set of inequalities but is much more
efficient. Finally, we discuss which inflations

hypotheses: first with an incoherently-radiating quasi-monochromatic point
source and the second with two identical closely spaced point sources. We are
given that the total number of photons collected over an integration time is
assumed to be the same under either hypothesis. For the one-source hypothesis,
the source is taken to be on-axis along the line of sight and for the
two-source hypothesis, we give ourselves the prior knowledge of the angular
separation of the sources, and they are assumed to be identical and located
symmetrically off-axis. This problem was studied by Helstrom in 1973, who
evaluated the probability of error achievable using a sub-optimal optical
measurement, with an unspecified structured realization. In this paper, we
evaluate the quantum Chernoff bound, a lower bound on the minimum probability
of error achievable by any physically-realizable receiver, which is
exponentially tight in the regime that the integration time is high. We give an
explicit structured receiver that separates three orthogonal spatial modes of
the aperture field followed by quantum-noise-limited time-resolved photon
measurement and show that this achieves the quantum Chernoff bound. In other
words, the classical Chernoff bound of our mode-resolved detector exactly
matches the quantum Chernoff bound for this problem. Finally, we evaluate the

hierarchical architecture for single-photon-based reinforcement learning and

the four-armed bandit problem is solved given zero prior knowledge in a
two-layer hierarchical architecture, where polarization is autonomously adapted
in order to effect adequate decision making using single-photon measurements.
In the hierarchical structure, the notion of layer-dependent decisions emerges.
The optimal solutions in the coarse layer and in the fine layer, however,
conflict with each other in some contradictive problems. We show that while
what we call a tournament strategy resolves such contradictions, the
probabilistic nature of single photons allows for the direct location of the

cached nearby, it is less useful to cache the file again. We propose several
novel spatially correlated caching strategies, and contrast them with the
baseline independent content placement which is used in most prior work. These
include (i) a spatially exchangeable content placement technique to prioritize
the caches for content placement and (ii) the "Gibbs" point process-based
soft-core caching model that captures the pairwise interactions between users,
including attraction or repulsion. We derive and optimize the \emph{hit
probability}, which is the probability that a given D2D node can find a desired
file at another node within its communication range. Exchangeable placement
actually performs worse than independent placement, while the Gibbs model shows
that repulsive cache placement often yields a higher hit probability. We
consider two further special cases of Gibbs repulsive cache placement: (ii.a)
the Fermi-Dirac and (ii.b) Mat\'{e}rn hard-core (MHC) models, and show that MHC
placement is effective for small cache sizes and a small communication radius,
which are likely conditions for D2D.

single session is becoming more prevalent. Prime examples include the desire to
implement WiFi offloading and the introduction of 5G. Furthermore, an
increasing fraction of Internet traffic is becoming delay sensitive. These two
trends drive the need to investigate methods that enable communication over
multiple parallel heterogeneous networks, while also ensuring that delay
constraints are met. This paper approaches these challenges using a multi-path
streaming code that uses forward error correction to reduce the in-order
delivery delay of packets in networks with poor link quality and transient
connectivity. A simple analysis is developed that provides a good approximation
of the in-order delivery delay. Furthermore, numerical results help show that
the delay penalty of communicating over multiple paths is insignificant when
considering the potential throughput gains obtained through the fusion of
multiple networks.

social networks with partial feedback. Although the influence maximization
problem problem has been extensively studies over the past ten years, majority
of existing work fall into one of the following categories: \emph{full-feedback
model} or \emph{zero-feedback model}. Full-feedback model has better
performance in terms of expected cascade, this is because it allows us to
adaptively choose the next seed after observing the actual spread resulting
from previously selected seeds. However, the viral marketing in reality is
often time-critical, implying that it is often impossible to reveal the full
status of the actual spread as assumed in full-feedback model. On the other
end, zero-feedback model has the minimum delay, however, it may have poor
performance since it does not utilize the observation that may be made during
the seeding process. To fill this gap, we propose \emph{Partial-feedback
Model}, which generalizes the previous two models by allowing us to balance the
tradeoff between performance and delay. Unfortunately, we show that the
objective under partial-feedback model is not adaptive submodular, implying
that existing results on adaptive submodular maximization does not apply to our

Hence,
weak supervision using only image tags could have a significant impact in
semantic segmentation. Recently, CNN-based methods have proposed to fine-tune

making use of objectness priors to generate foreground/background masks.
Unfortunately these priors either require training pixel-level

we propose a novel method to extract markedly more accurate masks from the

accomplished using the activations of the higher-level convolutional layers,

classifiers to output a set of plausible labels rather than a single label,
thereby giving a more appropriate and informative treatment to the labeling of
ambiguous instances. We introduce a framework for multiclass set-valued

while minimizing the ambiguity (the expected size of the output). We first
derive oracle classifiers assuming the true distribution to be known. We show
that the oracle classifiers are obtained from level sets of the functions that
define the conditional probability of each class. Then we develop estimators

numerous benefits: the knowledge graph can be built automatically from a
real-world corpus of data, new nodes - along with their combined edges - can be
instantly materialized from any arbitrary combination of preexisting nodes
(using set operations), and a full model of the semantic relationships between
all entities within a domain can be represented and dynamically traversed using
a highly compact representation of the graph. Such a system has widespread

This
is especially true in real world problems such as in social systems, where
there is a significant population of players involved in the game, and the
complexity problem is critical. Previous studies in algorithmic game theory
propose succinct games that enable small descriptions of payoff matrices and
reduction of complexities. However, some of the suggested compromises lose
generality with strict assumptions such as symmetries in utility functions and
cannot be applied to the full range of real world problems that may be
presented. Graphical games are relatively promising, with a good balance
between complexity and generality. However, they assume a given graph structure
of players' interactions and cannot be applied to games without such known
graphs. This study proposes a method to identify an interaction graph between
players and subsequently decompose games into smaller components by cutting out
weak interactions for the purpose of reducing complexity. At the beginning,
players' mutual dependencies on their utilities are quantified as
variance-covariance matrices among players. Then, the interaction graphs among
players are identified by solving eigenvalue problems. Players' interactions
are further decomposed into linear combinations of games. This helps to find a
consistent equilibrium, which is a Nash equilibrium specified by the
decomposition, with reduced computational complexity. Finally, experiments on
simple example games are shown to verify the proposed method.

fact that users typically search for new items or information, necessitating to
back-off to customization, but group profiles often suffer from accidental
features brought in by the unique individual contributing to the group. In this
paper we propose a generalized group profiling approach that teases apart the
exact contribution of the individual user level and the "abstract" group level
by extracting a latent model that captures all, and only, the essential
features of the whole group. Our main findings are the followings. First, we
propose an efficient way of group profiling which implicitly eliminates the
general and specific features from users' models in a group and takes out the
abstract model representing the whole group. Second, we employ the resulting

Third, we see that the granularity of groups affects the quality of group

proliferation of automated bots, creating both opportunities and challenges in
information dissemination, user engagements, and quality of services. Past
works on profiling bots had been focused largely on malicious bots, with the
assumption that these bots should be removed. In this work, however, we find
many bots that are benign, and propose a new, broader categorization of bots
based on their behaviors. This includes broadcast, consumption, and spam bots.
To facilitate comprehensive analyses of bots and how they compare to human
accounts, we develop a systematic profiling framework that includes a rich set
of features and classifier bank. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate
the performances of different classifiers under varying time windows, identify
the key features of bots, and infer about bots in a larger Twitter population.
Our analysis encompasses more than 159K bot and human (non-bot) accounts in
Twitter. The results provide interesting insights on the behavioral traits of
both benign and malicious bots.

phylogenetic trees into a binary rooted phylogenetic network such that the
number of nodes with indegree two is minimized. However, from a biological
point of view accurately inferring the root location in a phylogenetic tree is
notoriously difficult and poor root placement can artificially inflate the
hybridization number. To this end we study a number of relaxed variants of this
problem. We start by showing that the fundamental problem of determining
whether an \emph{unrooted} phylogenetic network displays (i.e. embeds) an
\emph{unrooted} phylogenetic tree, is NP-hard. On the positive side we show
that this problem is FPT in reticulation number. In the rooted case the
corresponding FPT result is trivial, but here we require more subtle
argumentation. Next we show that the hybridization number problem for unrooted
networks (when given two unrooted trees) is equivalent to the problem of
computing the Tree Bisection and Reconnect (TBR) distance of the two unrooted
trees. In the third part of the paper we consider the "root uncertain" variant
of hybridization number. Here we are free to choose the root location in each
of a set of unrooted input trees such that the hybridization number of the
resulting rooted trees is minimized. On the negative side we show that this
problem is APX-hard. On the positive side, we show that the problem is FPT in
the hybridization number, via kernelization, for any number of input trees.

direct access to the codebook, but only to noisy versions of the various
randomly generated codewords, a problem motivated by biometrical identification
systems. Both the source that generates the original (clean) codewords, and the
channel that corrupts them in generating the noisy codewords, as well as the
main channel for communicating the messages, are all modeled by non-unifilar,
finite-state systems (hidden Markov models). As in previous works on universal
decoding, here too, the average error probability of our proposed universal
decoder is shown to be as small as that of the optimal maximum likelihood (ML)
decoder, up to a multiplicative factorthat is a sub-exponential function of the
block length. It therefore has the same error exponent, whenever the ML decoder
has a positive error exponent. The universal decoding metric is based on
Lempel-Ziv (LZ) incremental parsing of each noisy codeword jointly with the
given channel output vector, but this metric is somewhat different from the one
proposed in earlier works on universal decoding for finite-state channels, by
Ziv (1985) and by Lapidoth and Ziv (1998). The reason for the difference is
that here, unlike in those earlier works, the probability distribution that
governs the (noisy) codewords is, in general, not uniform across its support.
This non-uniformity of the codeword distribution also makes our derivation more
challenging. Another reason for the more challenging analysis is the fact that
the effective induced channel between the noisy codeword of the transmitted
message and the main channel output is not a finite-state channel in general.

<p>In this paper we propose a model of user behavior on a SERP that jointly

the CAS model to build a novel evaluation metric that can be applied to
non-linear SERP layouts and that can account for the utility that users obtain

physical channel in massive MIMO systems can be converted into a
low-dimensional effective channel through the inner precoder to reduce the
overhead of channel estimation and feedback. The inner precoder depends on the
spatial covariance matrix of the channels, and thus the same precoder can be
used for different users as long as they have the same spatial covariance
matrix. Spatial covariance matrix is determined by the surrounding environment
of user terminals. Therefore, the users that are close to each other will share
the same spatial covariance matrix. In this situation, it is possible to
achieve user cooperation by sharing receiver information through some dedicated
link, such as device-to-device communications. To reduce the amount of
information that needs to be shared, we propose a decoding codebook based
scheme, which can achieve user cooperation without the need of channel state

the application level that include all effects induced by the network and by
the protocol stacks of the end systems. From our measurements, we identify
different causes for delays. We show that significant delays are due to
queueing in protocol stacks. Notably, this occurs even if the utilization is
moderate. Using our estimation method, we compare the impact of fundamental

Furthermore, building the fingerprints is a very time consuming process. In
this paper, we propose a novel localization framework by Fusing A Group Of

build a GrOup Of Fingerprints (GOOF), which includes five different
fingerprints, namely, RSS, covariance matrix, signal subspace, fractional low

transformations of the received signals from multiple antennas in the offline

algorithm to improve the accuracy of localization by combining the predictions
of multiple classifiers with different samples. As compared with the single

referred to as natural intelligence, has recently attracted interest from a
variety of fields, including post-silicon computing for artificial intelligence
and decision making in the behavioural sciences. In a past study, we
successfully used the wave-particle duality of single photons to solve the
two-armed bandit problem, which constitutes the foundation of reinforcement
learning and decision making. In this study, we propose and confirm a
hierarchical architecture for single-photon-based reinforcement learning and
decision making that verifies the scalability of the principle. Specifically,
the four-armed bandit problem is solved given zero prior knowledge in a
two-layer hierarchical architecture, where polarization is autonomously adapted
in order to effect adequate decision making using single-photon measurements.
In the hierarchical structure, the notion of layer-dependent decisions emerges.
The optimal solutions in the coarse layer and in the fine layer, however,
conflict with each other in some contradictive problems. We show that while
what we call a tournament strategy resolves such contradictions, the
probabilistic nature of single photons allows for the direct location of the
optimal solution even for contradictive problems, hence manifesting the
exploration ability of single photons. This study provides insights into photon
intelligence in hierarchical architectures for future artificial intelligence
as well as the potential of natural processes for intelligent functionalities.

calculations done by a person. This means that we can compute whatever any
Turing machine can compute, and therefore we are Turing complete. The question
addressed here is why, Why are we Turing complete? Being Turing complete also
means that somehow our brain implements the function that a universal Turing
machine implements. The point is that evolution achieved Turing completeness,
and then the explanation should be evolutionary, but our explanation is
mathematical. The trick is to introduce a mathematical theory of problems,
under the basic assumption that solving more problems provides more survival
opportunities. So we build a problem theory by fusing set and computing
theories. Then we construct a series of resolvers, where each resolver is
defined by its computing capacity, that exhibits the following property: all
problems solved by a resolver are also solved by the next resolver in the
series if certain condition is satisfied. The last of the conditions is to be
Turing complete. This series defines a resolvers hierarchy that could be seen
as a framework for the evolution of cognition. Then the answer to our question
would be: to solve most problems. By the way, the problem theory defines
adaptation, perception, and learning, and it shows that there are just three
ways to resolve any problem: routine, trial, and analogy. And, most
importantly, this theory demonstrates how problems can be used to found
mathematics and computing on biology.

convenient online collaboration. However, they require that clients fully trust
the service provider in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Towards reducing this dependency, this paper introduces a protocol for
verification of integrity and consistency for cloud object storage (VICOS),
which enables a group of mutually trusting clients to detect data-integrity and
consistency violations for a cloud object-storage service. It aims at services
where multiple clients cooperate on data stored remotely on a potentially
misbehaving service. VICOS enforces the consistency notion of
fork-linearizability, supports wait-free client semantics for most operations,
and reduces the computation and communication overhead compared to previous
protocols. VICOS is based in a generic way on any authenticated data structure.
Moreover, its operations cover the hierarchical name space of a cloud object
store, supporting a real-world interface and not only a simplistic abstraction.
A prototype of VICOS that works with the key-value store interface of commodity
cloud storage services has been implemented, and an evaluation demonstrates its
advantage compared to existing systems.

Our method successfully fools humans on 32% of the trials, significantly higher

algorithms correcting the approximation error of BP, i.e., we provide a way to
compensate for BP errors via a consecutive BP-aware MCMC. Our framework is
based on the Loop Calculus (LC) approach which allows to express the BP error
as a sum of weighted generalized loops. Although the full series is
computationally intractable, it is known that a truncated series, summing up
all 2-regular loops, is computable in polynomial-time for planar pair-wise
binary GMs and it also provides a highly accurate approximation empirically.
Motivated by this, we first propose a polynomial-time approximation MCMC scheme
for the truncated series of general (non-planar) pair-wise binary models. Our
main idea here is to use the Worm algorithm, known to provide fast mixing in
other (related) problems, and then design an appropriate rejection scheme to
sample 2-regular loops. Furthermore, we also design an efficient rejection-free
MCMC scheme for approximating the full series. The main novelty underlying our
design is in utilizing the concept of cycle basis, which provides an efficient

run on transformed GM built upon the non-trivial BP solution, and our

real-life persons so that each partition contains records pertaining to a
unique person. Most of the existing solutions for this task operate in a batch
mode, where all records to be disambiguated are initially available to the
algorithm. However, more realistic settings require that the name
disambiguation task be performed in an online fashion, in addition to, being
able to identify records of new ambiguous entities having no preexisting
records. In this work, we propose a Bayesian non-exhaustive classification
framework for solving online name disambiguation task. Our proposed method uses
a Dirichlet process prior with a Normal * Normal * Inverse Wishart data model
which enables identification of new ambiguous entities who have no records in
the training data. For online classification, we use one sweep Gibbs sampler
which is very efficient and effective. As a case study we consider
bibliographic data in a temporal stream format and disambiguate authors by
partitioning their papers into homogeneous groups. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method is better than existing methods for
performing online name disambiguation task.

heterogeneous wireless networks. Measuring the physical or link level
performance on a given wireless access networks does not provide a reliable
indication of the actually perceived level of service. It is therefore needed
to take measurements at IP level, on the (bidirectional) paths from the Mobile
Host to the node that is handling the mobility, over different heterogeneous
networks. In this paper, we propose and analyze mechanisms for connectivity
check and performance (network delay and packet loss) monitoring over IP access
networks, combining active and passive monitoring techniques. We evaluate the
accuracy and timeliness of the performance estimates and provide guidelines for
tuning up the parameters. From the implementation perspective, we show that
using application level measurements is highly CPU intensive, while a kernel
based implementation has comparably a very low CPU usage. The Linux kernel
implementation results in an efficient use of batteries in Mobile Hosts and
intermediate Mobility Management Nodes can scale up to monitoring thousands of
flows. The proposed solutions have been implemented in the context of a
specific mobility management solution, but the results are of general
applicability. The Linux implementation is available as Open Source.

features for semantic video segmentation. Current work on convolutional neural
networks(CNNs) has shown that CNNs provide advanced spatial features supporting
a very good performance of solutions for both image and video analysis,
especially for the semantic segmentation task. We investigate how involving
temporal features also has a good effect on segmenting video data. We propose a
module based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture of a recurrent
neural network for interpreting the temporal characteristics of video frames
over time. Our system takes as input frames of a video and produces a
correspondingly-sized output; for segmenting the video our method combines the
use of three components: First, the regional spatial features of frames are
extracted using a CNN; then, using LSTM the temporal features are added;
finally, by deconvolving the spatio-temporal features we produce pixel-wise
predictions. Our key insight is to build spatio-temporal convolutional networks
(spatio-temporal CNNs) that have an end-to-end architecture for semantic video
segmentation. We adapted fully some known convolutional network architectures
(such as FCN-AlexNet and FCN-VGG16), and dilated convolution into our
spatio-temporal CNNs. Our spatio-temporal CNNs achieve state-of-the-art
semantic segmentation, as demonstrated for the Camvid and NYUDv2 datasets.

naturally motivates the study of distributed graph layout algorithms, able to
scale to very large graphs. Nowadays, to process Big Data, companies are
increasingly relying on PaaS infrastructures rather than buying and maintaining
complex and expensive hardware. So far, only a few examples of basic
force-directed algorithms that work in a distributed environment have been
described. Instead, the design of a distributed multilevel force-directed
algorithm is a much more challenging task, not yet addressed. We present the
first multilevel force-directed algorithm based on a distributed vertex-centric

frameworks that have been extensively used for specifying systems that exhibit
modalities such as temporal or spatial ones. Both frameworks have linear logic
(LL) as a common ground and they admit (cut-free) complete focused proof
systems. The difference between the two logics relies on the way modalities are
handled. In HyLL, truth judgments are labelled by worlds and hybrid connectives
relate worlds with formulas. In SELL, the linear logic exponentials (!, ?) are
decorated with labels representing locations, and an ordering on such labels
defines the provability relation among resources in those locations. It is well
known that SELL, as a logical framework, is strictly more expressive than LL.
However, so far, it was not clear whether HyLL is more expressive than LL
and/or SELL. In this paper, we show an encoding of the HyLL's logical rules
into LL with the highest level of adequacy, hence showing that HyLL is as
expressive as LL. We also propose an encoding of HyLL into SELL $\doublecup$
(SELL plus quantification over locations) that gives better insights about the
meaning of worlds in HyLL. We conclude our expressiveness study by showing that
previous attempts of encoding Computational Tree Logic (CTL) operators into
HyLL cannot be extended to consider the whole set of temporal connectives. We
show that a system of LL with fixed points is indeed needed to faithfully
encode the behavior of such temporal operators.

and many algorithms have been developed for finding dense subgraphs from large
graphs that contain given query nodes. In applications such as analysis of
protein protein interaction (PPI) networks, citation graphs, and collaboration
networks, nodes tend to have attributes. Unfortunately, previously developed
community search algorithms ignore these attributes and result in communities
with poor cohesion w.r.t. their node attributes. In this paper, we study the
problem of attribute-driven community search, that is, given an undirected
graph $G$ where nodes are associated with attributes, and an input query $Q$
consisting of nodes $V_q$ and attributes $W_q$, find the communities containing
$V_q$, in which most community members are densely inter-connected and have
similar attributes.
</p>
<p>We formulate our problem of finding attributed truss communities (ATC), as
finding all connected and close k-truss subgraphs containing $V_q$, that are
locally maximal and have the largest attribute relevance score among such
subgraphs. We design a novel attribute relevance score function and establish
its desirable properties. The problem is shown to be NP-hard. However, we
develop an efficient greedy algorithmic framework, which finds a maximal
$k$-truss containing $V_q$, and then iteratively removes the nodes with the
least popular attributes and shrinks the graph so as to satisfy community
constraints. We also build an elegant index to maintain the known $k$-truss
structure and attribute information, and propose efficient query processing
algorithms. Extensive experiments on large real-world networks with
ground-truth communities shows the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed
methods.

This month, the group voted to propose the Anthropocene as the Holocene's successor, with its start at the industrial boom that followed World War II. Before a formal submission can go to the International Commission on Stratigraphy, the bureaucracy that governs geologic time, researchers must still identify a stratigraphic section rich in geochemical markers of this postwar transition. They have a high bar to clear: Many stratigraphers are skeptical of their initiative and fear being drawn into a political statement.

Nearly 5 years ago the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) endorsed National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommendations that pediatricians draw blood from all 9- to 11-year-olds and test their cholesterol levels. In strongly worded comments, several physicians welcomed the conclusions of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and upbraided AAP for a position whose health benefits they consider inadequate to justify the medical risks and financial costs of cholesterol screening in all kids. AAP representatives say they stand by screening, although they acknowledge the unknowns.

The study provoked controversy when it was first published, with some complaining that it unfairly held the fossil fuel industry responsible for the lifestyle choices made by billions of consumers. Others, however, saw it as a turning point in the debate about apportioning responsibility for climate change. Now, Heede's carbon accounting is opening a new chapter in climate change litigation and policy, helping equip plaintiffs who believe they have suffered damages from climate change to claim compensation.

But more recently, scientists have discovered that a strain named genotype 3 is a problem in Western countries as well, especially in Europe. An estimated 300,000 people get infected annually in Germany alone, and although the vast majority clears the infection easily and without symptoms, the virus persists in the liver of people with weakened immune systems, eventually killing them. Some people get infected through blood donations, but most infections come from eating contaminated pork. The big question now is how the hepatitis E virus can be stopped.

It wants to distribute this product to those who need it, but not everyone needs or will use the product. Thus, if the organization gives the product away for free, a substantial amount may be wasted. On page 889 of this issue, Dupas et al. show that introducing small hassles, such as visiting a store each month to redeem a voucher, can be a much more effective way of reducing wastage than charging for the product (1).

Recent studies help to elucidate these challenges and show how research can be effective in underpinning conservation decisions (25).

This interaction results from large-scale, slowly moving extratropical storms but also from smaller, intense weather systems such as tropical cyclones (called hurricanes in the Atlantic and eastern Pacific, and typhoons in the western Pacific). These are smaller storms, often travel much faster, and have steeper atmospheric pressure gradients that produce very strong winds. All storm systems generate various types of microseisms, which have been studied extensively. A special case of fast-developing, small, extratropical storms in which the central pressure intensifies rapidly, dropping by more than 1 mbar/hour for 24 hours, is called a weather bomb (1). On page 919 of this issue, Nishida and Takagi (2) report on the detection of previously unobserved S wave microseisms generated under a weather bomb between Greenland and Iceland.

Three prolyl hydroxylases target the HIF molecules, EglN1 (PHD2), EglN2 (PHD1), and EglN3 (PHD3) (1). All three are widely expressed iron (Fe++) and -ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. When the oxygen tension is normal, they hydroxylate HIF1 and HIF2. Hydroxylated HIF molecules are recognized and ubiquitinated by an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex containing the von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor protein pVHL (1), leading to their proteasomal degradation. Inactivation of prolyl hydroxylases during hypoxia results in the stabilization of HIF molecules. On page 929 of this issue, Guo et al. present evidence that a prolyl hydroxylation-dependent pathway also plays an important role in the regulation of the Akt kinase, which in turn is a key player in oncogenesis (2).

With so little progress made toward finding a cureor, better, a preventionit is time to rethink the path to progress. This requires a change in perspective on the type of research that will make a difference. The lesson learned from cancer research is that a new commitment means rethinking the fundamental approach to the disease. Cancer research moved from taking potshots with, usually, cytotoxic drugs to a bottom-up, mechanism-based approach in which newly acquired genetic knowledge played the largest role. Today, that effort has produced a platform of knowledge from which academia and industry are drawing. For neurodegenerative disease, the genetic approach remains valid but the problem must concurrently be approached from a complementary, robust cell biological perspective, focusing on the cellular cascade of events that lead to neuronal cell death.

In September 2016, a high-level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) will discuss how countries can cooperate to preserve global access to effective antimicrobials. This will be only the fourth health issue (and the first One Health issue, integrating human, animal, and environmental health) to bring together heads of state at the UNGA for a rare opportunity to set a global agenda to combat the crisis. We believe that (i) setting targets for reducing drug-resistant infections, (ii) adequate financing for global action, and (iii) defining the global health architecture to address AMR should be elements of a UN plan.

We review recent advances in the design of electronic and optoelectronic devices that use colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). The properties of materials assembled of QDs may be tailored not only by the atomic composition but also by the size, shape, and surface functionalization of the individual QDs and by the communication among these QDs. The chemical and physical properties of QD surfaces and the interfaces in QD devices are of particular importance, and these enable the solution-based fabrication of low-cost, large-area, flexible, and functional devices. We discuss challenges that must be addressed in the move to solution-processed functional optoelectronic nanomaterials.

We used reverse genetics and heterologous expression to identify the enzyme for Chl f synthesis. Null mutants of super-rogue psbA4 genes, divergent paralogs of psbA genes encoding the D1 core subunit of photosystem II, abolished Chl f synthesis in two cyanobacteria that grow in far-red light. Heterologous expression of the psbA4 gene, which we rename chlF, enables Chl f biosynthesis in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. Because the reaction requires light, Chl f synthase is probably a photo-oxidoreductase that employs catalytically useful Chl a molecules, tyrosine YZ, and plastoquinone (as does photosystem II) but lacks a Mn4Ca1O5 cluster. Introduction of Chl f biosynthesis into crop plants could expand their ability to use solar energy.

Retinol-binding protein (RBP) is the sole specific carrier in the bloodstream for hydrophobic retinol, the main form in which vitamin A is transported. The integral membrane receptor STRA6 mediates cellular uptake of vitamin A by recognizing RBP-retinol to trigger release and internalization of retinol. We present the structure of zebrafish STRA6 determined to 3.9-angstrom resolution by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. STRA6 has one intramembrane and nine transmembrane helices in an intricate dimeric assembly. Unexpectedly, calmodulin is bound tightly to STRA6 in a noncanonical arrangement. Residues involved with RBP binding map to an archlike structure that covers a deep lipophilic cleft. This cleft is open to the membrane, suggesting a possible mode for internalization of retinol through direct diffusion into the lipid bilayer.

However, the mere 320-day half-life of berkeliums only available isotope, 249Bk, has hindered in-depth studies of the elements coordination chemistry. Herein, we report the synthesis and detailed solid-state and solution-phase characterization of a berkelium coordination complex, Bk(III)tris(dipicolinate), as well as a chemically distinct Bk(III) borate material for comparison. We demonstrate that berkeliums complexation is analogous to that of californium. However, from a range of spectroscopic techniques and quantum mechanical calculations, it is clear that spin-orbit coupling contributes significantly to berkeliums multiconfigurational ground state.

A cost concern about free provision is that some recipients may not use the product, wasting resources (overinclusion). Yet, charging a price to screen out nonusers may screen out poor people who need and would use the product (overexclusion). We report on a randomized controlled trial of a screening mechanism that combines the free provision of chlorine solution for water treatment with a small nonmonetary cost (household vouchers that need to be redeemed monthly in order). Relative to a nonvoucher free distribution program, this mechanism reduces the quantity of chlorine procured by 60 percentage points, but reduces the share of households whose stored water tests positive for chlorine residual by only one percentage point, substantially improving the trade-off between overinclusion and overexclusion.

Here we report an atomic structure of a catalytic step I spliceosome (known as the C complex) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as determined by cryoelectron microscopy at an average resolution of 3.4 angstroms. In the structure, the 2-OH of the invariant adenine nucleotide in the branch point sequence (BPS) is covalently joined to the phosphate at the 5 end of the 5 splice site (5SS), forming an intron lariat. The freed 5 exon remains anchored to loop I of U5 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), and the 5SS and BPS of the intron form duplexes with conserved U6 and U2 snRNA sequences, respectively. Specific placement of these RNA elements at the catalytic cavity of Prp8 is stabilized by 15 protein components, including Snu114 and the splicing factors Cwc21, Cwc22, Cwc25, and Yju2. These features, representing the conformation of the spliceosome after the first-step reaction, predict structural changes that are needed for the execution of the second-step transesterification reaction.

Here, we report an atomic structure of an activated spliceosome (known as the Bact complex) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, determined by cryoelectron microscopy at an average resolution of 3.52 angstroms. The final refined model contains U2 and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs), U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), nineteen complex (NTC), NTC-related (NTR) protein, and a 71-nucleotide pre-mRNA molecule, which amount to 13,505 amino acids from 38 proteins and a combined molecular mass of about 1.6 megadaltons. The 5 exon is anchored by loop I of U5 snRNA, whereas the 5 splice site (5SS) and the branch-point sequence (BPS) of the intron are specifically recognized by U6 and U2 snRNA, respectively. Except for coordination of the catalytic metal ions, the RNA elements at the catalytic cavity of Prp8 are mostly primed for catalysis. The catalytic latency is maintained by the SF3b complex, which encircles the BPS, and the splicing factors Cwc24 and Prp11, which shield the 5 exon5SS junction. This structure, together with those determined earlier, outlines a molecular framework for the pre-mRNA splicing reaction.

Chemical derivatization of these diterpenoids has demonstrated that certain peripheral structural modifications can alter binding affinity and selectivity among ryanodine receptor isoforms. Here, we report a short chemical synthesis of (+)-ryanodol that proceeds in only 15 steps from the commercially available terpene (S)-pulegone. The efficiency of the synthesis derives from the use of a Pauson-Khand reaction to rapidly build the carbon framework and a SeO2-mediated oxidation to install three oxygen atoms in a single step. This work highlights how strategic CO bond constructions can streamline the synthesis of polyhydroxylated terpenes by minimizing protecting group and redox adjustments.

In this regime, the relative roles of inter- and intraband light-driven electronic transitions remain uncertain. We applied attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to investigate the interaction between polycrystalline diamond and a few-femtosecond infrared pulse with intensity below the critical intensity of optical breakdown. Ab initio time-dependent density functional theory calculations, in tandem with a two-band parabolic model, accounted for the experimental results in the framework of the dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect and identified infrared induction of intraband currents as the main physical mechanism responsible for the observations.

Delineation of the source locations and energy partition of the seismic wave components are key to understanding the excitation mechanisms. Using a seismic array in Japan, we observed both P and S wave microseisms excited by a severe distant storm in the Atlantic Ocean. Although nonlinear forcing of an ocean swell with a one-dimensional Earth model can explain P waves and vertically polarized S waves (SV waves), it cannot explain horizontally polarized S waves (SH waves). The precise source locations may provide a new catalog for exploring Earths interior.

Here we present a straightforward approach for addressing complexity in dynamic interconnected systems. We show that complexity, in the form of multiple interacting components, can actually be an asset for studying natural systems from temporal data. The central idea is that multidimensional time series enable system dynamics to be reconstructed from multiple viewpoints, and these viewpoints can be combined into a single model. We show how our approach, multiview embedding (MVE), can improve forecasts for simulated ecosystems and a mesocosm experiment. By leveraging complexity, MVE is particularly effective for overcoming the limitations of short and noisy time series and should be highly relevant for many areas of science.

However, it is difficult to capture rare dynamic processes, such as adult neurogenesis, because isolation of rare neurons from adult tissue is challenging and markers for each phase are limited. Here, we develop Div-Seq, which combines scalable single-nucleus RNA-Seq (sNuc-Seq) with pulse labeling of proliferating cells by 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) to profile individual dividing cells. sNuc-Seq and Div-Seq can sensitively identify closely related hippocampal cell types and track transcriptional dynamics of newborn neurons within the adult hippocampal neurogenic niche, respectively. We also apply Div-Seq to identify and profile rare newborn neurons in the adult spinal cord, a noncanonical neurogenic region. sNuc-Seq and Div-Seq open the way for unbiased analysis of diverse complex tissues.

Hypoxia promotes the resistance of tumor cells to specific therapies. We therefore explored a possible link between hypoxia and Akt activity. We found that Akt was prolyl-hydroxylated by the oxygen-dependent hydroxylase EglN1. The von HippelLindau protein (pVHL) bound directly to hydroxylated Akt and inhibited Akt activity. In cells lacking oxygen or functional pVHL, Akt was activated to promote cell survival and tumorigenesis. We also identified cancer-associated Akt mutations that impair Akt hydroxylation and subsequent recognition by pVHL, thus leading to Akt hyperactivation. Our results show that microenvironmental changes, such as hypoxia, can affect tumor behaviors by altering Akt activation, which has a critical role in tumor growth and therapeutic resistance.

We identified host molecules that are essential for murine NoV (MNoV)induced cell death, including CD300lf as a proteinaceous receptor. We found that CD300lf is essential for MNoV binding and replication in cell lines and primary cells. Additionally, Cd300lf/ mice are resistant to MNoV infection. Expression of CD300lf in human cells breaks the species barrier that would otherwise restrict MNoV replication. The crystal structure of the CD300lf ectodomain reveals a potential ligand-binding cleft composed of residues that are critical for MNoV infection. Therefore, the presence of a proteinaceous receptor is the primary determinant of MNoV species tropism, whereas other components of cellular machinery required for NoV replication are conserved between humans and mice.

Once outside the Airlock, the crew performed the following scheduled tasks: Retract, cover, and cinch down the TTCR using hook straps Replace a failed External Television Camera Group (ETVCG) light at the Camera Port 9 (CP9) location Install a High Definition Camera in the CP9 location Re-torque the Alpha Joint Interface Structure (AJIS) Struts on the Port 4 (P4) truss Perform an inspection Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ) Port 6 (P6) Pump Flow and Control System (PFCS) Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) Tie-back The crew was ahead on the timeline, so they were also able to install an additional High Definition Camera at the CP8 location, and perform the Port Crew and Equipment Translation Aid (CETA) Cart Brake Handle Tie-Down task. While Williams and Rubin were outside, FE-5 Onishi operated the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) and assisted with the tasks. The EVA duration was 6 hours, 48 minutes. Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations for EVA: Today Robotics Ground Controllers powered up the MSS to support the TTCR EVA. Once the EVA crew completed the TTCR retract, FE-5 maneuvered the SSRMS into position to install an Articulating Portable Foot Restraint (APFR) on the SSRMS Latching End Effector (LEE). CDR ingressed the APFR, and the SSRMS was maneuvered to allow CDR to change the light of the CP9 (P1 Lower Outboard (LOOB)) camera then again to position CDR to install an External High Definition Camera (EHDC) on the CP9 camera. Once the CP9 tasks had been completed, the SSRMS was maneuvered to position CDR to install an EHDC on the CP8 (P1 Upper Outboard (UPOB)) camera. Once this had been completed, the SSRMS was moved to a park position. MSS performance today was nominal. Todays Planned Activities All activities were completed unless otherwise noted.

This afternoon the crew performed a conference with EVA ground specialist to discuss any final question about tomorrows TTCR EVA. The crew also prepared the Equipment Lock, EMUs and ancillary hardware to support EVA prep activities. Crew egress of the Airlock is scheduled for 7:10 am CDT. Multi-Omics sample collections: Flight Engineer-5 collected samples for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Multi-Omics experiment. Samples were then placed into the Minus Eighty Degree Celsius Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI). The Multi-omics analysis of human microbial-metabolic cross-talk in the space ecosystem (Multi-Omics) investigation evaluates the impacts of space environment and prebiotics on astronauts immune function, by combining the data obtained from the measurements of changes in the gut microbiological composition, metabolites profiles, and the immune system. Biomarkers for immune dysfunction during the crewmembers time on the ISS could be useful for the health management of astronauts. Habitability walkthrough: The Commander performed his sixth and final Habitability walkthrough video. Williams has been requested to focus on the windows available to the crew on the ISS, and their impact on habitability and productivity. The Habitability investigation results will be used to assess the relationship between crew members and their environment in order to better prepare for future long-duration spaceflights. Observations recorded during 6 month and 1 year missions can help spacecraft designers determine how much habitable volume is required, and whether a missions duration impacts how much space crew members need. Fine Motor Skills (FMS): Flight Engineer-5 completed his 9th of 20 sessions of FMS. Performing a series of interactive tasks on a touchscreen tablet were completed for the Fine Motor Skills investigation. This investigation is critical during long-duration space missions, particularly those skills needed to interact with technologies required in next-generation space vehicles, spacesuits, and habitats. The crewmembers fine motor skills are also necessary for performing tasks in transit or on a planetary surface, such as information access, just-in-time training, subsystem maintenance, and medical treatment. Circadian Rhythms: After 36 hours of wear-time, Flight Engineer-5 doffed the Double Sensors and Thermolab Control Unit and stowed the equipment. The objective of the experiment is to get a better understanding of any alterations in circadian rhythms in humans during long-term space flights. Such knowledge will not only provide important insights into the adaptations of the human autonomic nervous system in space over time, but also has significant practical implications by helping to improve physical exercise, rest- and work shifts as well as fostering adequate workplace illumination in the sense of occupational healthcare in future space missions.

The goal of the Cardio Ox investigation is to determine whether biological markers of oxidative and inflammatory stress are elevated during and after space flight and whether this results in an increased, long-term risk of atherosclerosis risk in astronauts. Twelve crewmembers provide blood and urine samples to assess biomarkers before launch, 15 and 60 days after launch, 15 days before returning to Earth, and within days after landing. Ultrasound scans of the carotid and brachial arteries are obtained at the same time points, as well as through 5 years after landing, as an indicator of cardiovascular health. Dose Tracker: The crew completed entries for medication tracking on an iPad today. This investigation documents the medication usage of crewmembers before and during their missions by capturing data regarding medication use during spaceflight, including side effect qualities, frequencies and severities. The data is expected to either support or counter anecdotal evidence of medication ineffectiveness during flight and unusual side effects experienced during flight. It is also expected that specific, near-real-time questioning about symptom relief and side effects will provide the data required to establish whether spaceflight-associated alterations in pharmacokinetics (PK) or pharmacodynamics (PD) is occurring during missions. Fine Motor Skills: A series of interactive tasks were completed for the Fine Motor Skills investigation. This investigation is critical during long-duration space missions, particularly those skills needed to interact with technologies required in next-generation space vehicles, spacesuits, and habitats. The crewmembers fine motor skills are also necessary for performing tasks in transit or on a planetary surface, such as information access, just-in-time training, subsystem maintenance, and medical treatment. Habitability Human Factors Directed Observations: The crew recorded and submitted a walk-through video documenting observations of life onboard ISS, providing insight related to human factors and habitability. The Habitability investigation collects observations about the relationship between crew members and their environment on the ISS. Observations can help spacecraft designers understand how much habitable volume is required, and whether a missions duration impacts how much space crew members need. Trailing Thermal Control Radiator (TTCR) Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparations: The EV crew continued the EVA tool configuration in preparation for the TTCR EVA on Thursday. The IV crew accessed the Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics (DOUG) software and completed additional robotics reviews of Space Station Remote Manipulator System support plan for the EVA. External Television Camera Group (ETVCG) Troubleshooting: The crew performed a procedure to verify that the heaters on the spare ETVCG Light are functional. They utilized the two jumpers that were built from pin kit materials and tested the ETVCG light and heaters. After the troubleshooting, the crew confirmed a functional camera light and heater circuit on the ETVCG. This light will be used to replace the degraded light at the P1 Lower Outboard location during Thursdays TTCR EVA. Todays Planned Activities All activities completed unless otherwise noted.

The Biomolecule Sequencer investigation seeks to demonstrate for the first time that DNA sequencing is feasible in an orbiting spacecraft. A space-based DNA sequencer could identify microbes, diagnose diseases and understand crew member health, and potentially help detect DNA-based life elsewhere in the solar system. Marrow Blood, Breath, and Ambient Air Sample Collection: Over the weekend the crew set up the Marrow air sample collection hardware in the crew quarters and today upon waking the crew took breath and ambient air samples to measure carbon monoxide concentration for the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) Marrow experiment. Marrow investigates the effect of microgravity on human bone marrow. It is believed that microgravity, like long-duration bed rest on Earth, has a negative effect on bone marrow and the blood cells that are produced in the marrow. The extent of this effect and its recovery are of interest to space research and healthcare providers on Earth. Human Research Program (HRP) Generic Urine and Frozen Blood Collection Double Spin: The crew continued HRP operations that began over the weekend by collecting saliva and urine samples for 24-hours and processing a set of blood samples for double spin operations using the Refrigerated Centrifuge. The samples were stowed in the Minus Eighty-degree Freezer for ISS MELFI. Mouse Epigenetics Closeout and Reconfiguration Operations: The crew performed Mouse Epigenetics closeout and reconfiguration activities to clean up and disassemble the Glove Box before removing the Mouse Habitat Cage Unit from the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF). The crew also changed the CBEF video output cable configuration from multiple channel cable to single channel cable and disconnect the CBEF Multiple Video Cable between CBEF and Image Processing Unit (IPU) as well as the CBEF and Video compression and Recording Unit 2 (VRU2) on Multi-purpose Small PayloadRack2 (MSPR2). Thermolab Instrumentation for Circadian Rhythms: The crew began the first of a three-day European Space Agency (ESA) Circadian Rhythms experiment by performing instrumentation with the Thermolab Double sensors, mounting the Thermolab Unit in the belt, connecting and powering on the Thermolab Unit before beginning a 36 hour continuous measurement. After the measurement was completed, the data was transferred and hardware stowed. The objective of the experiment is to get a better understanding of alterations in circadian rhythms in humans during long-term space flights. Such knowledge will not only provide important insights into the adaptations of the human autonomic nervous system in space over time, but also has significant practical implications by helping to improve physical exercise, rest and work shifts as well as fostering adequate workplace illumination in the sense of occupational healthcare in future space missions. Multi-Omics Operations: Today the crew supported the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Multi-Omics investigation by collecting body samples and inserting them into a Box Module in the Minus Eighty-degree Freezer for ISS (MELFI). The investigation evaluates the impacts of space environment and prebiotics on astronauts immune function by combining the data obtained from the measurements of changes in the microbiological composition, metabolites profiles, and the immune system. Habitability Human Factors Directed Observations: The crew will recorded and submited a walk-through video documenting observations of life onboard ISS, providing insight related to human factors and habitability. The Habitability investigation collects observations about the relationship between crew members and their environment on the ISS. Observations can help spacecraft designers understand how much habitable volume is required and whether a missions duration impacts how much space crew members need. Trailing Thermal Control Radiator (TTCR) Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparations: The Extravehicular (EV) crew conducted a review of procedures that cover the suit donning plan, pre-breathe protocol, Equipment Lock activities, egress and detailed EVA timeline. Following the review they participated in a conference with ground teams. The Intravehicular (IV) crew accessed the Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics (DOUG) software and completed a robotics review of Space Station Remote Manipulator System support plan for US EVA #37 this Thursday. External Television Camera Group (ETVCG) Troubleshooting Test Lead Build: The crew performed part 1 of a procedure to verify the heaters on the spare ETVCG Light are functional. They built two jumpers from pin kit materials for use in tomorrow&#8217;s task. Remote Power Control Module (RPCM) Remove &#38; Replace (R&#38;R): Over the weekend, Robotics Ground Controllers unstowed the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) from Mobile Base System (MBS) Power Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF)2. At the end of re-rigidizing the SPDM Latching End Effector (LEE) for SPDM unstow, the SPDM safed, which has been observed previously. Controllers performed the necessary recovery steps and released the SPDM LEE from MBS PDGF2. Once the SPDM had been unstowed, controllers maneuvered the SSRMS and SPDM to position SPDM Arm2 to use Robot Micro Conical Tool #2 (RMCT2) to demate and remove RPCM P12B_A from its slot which was previously attempted on June 14, 2016 without success. Today, after numerous pull and wiggle attempts, the RPCM came out of its slot. Both the RPCM and its slot were inspected and nothing was seen that would preclude pressing with stowing the RPCM in a spare slot and installing another RPCM in Slot P12B_A. This RPCM was then stowed in Spare Slot P13A_H. Controllers commanded the SPDM Arm 2 On-Orbit Replaceable Unit (ORU) Tool Change-out Mechanism (OTCM) handling the RMCT2 to release the Failed RPCM (removed from P12B_A slot) in the P13A_H slot. They then maneuvered the SSRMS and SPDM to position SPDM Arm2 to align RMCT2 with the spare RPCM located in P11A_D to demate and remove it from its slot. This RPCM was then moved to the P12B_A slot. It was successfully inserted and bolted to P12B_A worksite after being pushed with the maximum force allowed of 200 N. SPDM Arm 2 released the spare RPCM in P12B_A and ground teams confirmed it was functioning nominally. 46 Soyuz Survey: Following the RPCM R&#38;R, [&#8230;]</p></details></div><div><details><summary class='inner'><a href='https://blogs.nasa.gov/stationreport/2016/08/26/iss-daily-summary-report-08262016/' target='_blank'>ISS Daily Summary Report  08/26/2016</a></summary><p>SpaceX (SpX)-9 Release: Following the unberth of Dragon yesterday afternoon, the crew used the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) to release Dragon at 5:11 AM Central Time for its return to Earth. The Dragon capsule executed a de-orbit burn shortly after 10 AM Central Time, and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean approximately 45 minutes later. SpaceX-9 returned cargo and science samples which were processed onboard the ISS for analysis on the ground. Biological Rhythms 48 Holter and Actiwatch Removal and Data Save: Following two consecutive days of Biological Rhythms recording sessions, the crew removed the Digital Walk Holter Electrocardiogram (ECG) and the Actiwatch Spectrum and saved the collected data to the medical laptop. This concluded the Biological Rhythms experiment where two separate 24-hour Actiwatch measurements were performed to study the effects of long-term microgravity exposure on heart functions by analyzing an astronauts electrocardiogram for 48 hours. Biomolecule Sequencer Hardware Setup and Sample Initialization: The crew retrieved the Flow Cell and the Media Syringe Tube from Minus Eighty-degree Freezer for ISS (MELFI) before using the syringe to inject the sample into the Biomolecule Sequencer, which began the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing process. The Biomolecule Sequencer investigation seeks to demonstrate for the first time that DNA sequencing is feasible in an orbiting spacecraft. A space-based DNA sequencer could identify microbes, diagnose diseases and understand crew member health, and potentially help detect DNA-based life elsewhere in the solar system. Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) Manifold Bottle Replacement: The crew R&#38;Rd a CIR manifold bottle on one of the four CIR Manifolds in support of upcoming Flex 2 payload investigation activities. Fine Motor Skills: A series of interactive tasks on a touchscreen tablet were completed for the Fine Motor Skills investigation. This investigation is critical during long-duration space missions, particularly those skills needed to interact with technologies required in next-generation space vehicles, spacesuits, and habitats. The crewmembers fine motor skills are also necessary for performing tasks in transit or on a planetary surface, such as information access, just-in-time training, subsystem maintenance, and medical treatment. Space Headaches: The crew completed the European Space Agency (ESA) Space Headaches questionnaire which provides information that may help in the development of methods to alleviate associated symptoms and improvement in the well-being and performance of crew members in space. LS-1 Server Issues: Following the recent issues with the LS-1 server, the crew performed a laptop shell swap (motherboard, processor, memory) and retained only the hard drives. The LS-1 came back online without any issues. LAB RWS Monitor Display Issue: Prior to Dragon release, the SSRMS Lab Robotic Work Station (RWS) Monitor 1 was observed to be very dim, with the image shifted, and it seemed to be a negative image. The crew tried the brightness adjustment and checked the cables with no success. The video feed was moved from the degraded display Monitor 1 to a Monitor 3 which was operating nominally. The release and departure monitoring were completed nominally and on time. The LAB RWS Monitor 1 was later recovered by power cycling the Control Electronic Unit (CEU). The root cause is still under investigation. Todays Planned Activities All activities were completed unless otherwise noted. MORZE.

This reboost was to set up for 46S landing. Biological Rhythms 48 Holter Start: The crew began the operations phase of the Biological Rhythms experiment by attaching the Digital Walk Holter Electrocardiogram (ECG) and electrodes and initiating the first of two 24-hour measurements. The objective of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Biological Rhythms 48 is to study the effects of long-term microgravity exposure on heart function by analyzing an astronauts electrocardiogram for 48 hours. Mouse Epigenetics Transfer and Reconfiguration Operations: Crewmembers detached the Mouse Habitat Cage Unit from the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF) Incubator Unit (IU) Micro-G and 1G and transferred mice from Mouse Habitat Cage Unit to Transportation Cage Unit. The crew also reconfigured the CBEF video cables for the Image Processing Unit (IPU) and the Video Compression and Recording Unit 2 (VRU2). NanoRack Module 9: The crew completed the last of the 5 NanoRack Module 9 experiment sessions by activating, deactivating, and shaking the mixture tubes to facilitate the experiment. Module-9 is a collection of student research projects utilizing the NanoRacks Mixsticks. Student teams from across the United States design their own experiments using flight approved fluids and materials. The investigation consists of several science experiments flown in a NanoRacks Module on board the ISS. Plant Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) Regulation Preparation: To prepare for the Plant RNA Regulation investigation run that begins next month, the experiment containers on the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) Rotors A and B were replaced with new experiment containers. Plant RNA Regulation studies the first steps of gene expression involved in development of roots and shoots. Scientists expect to find new molecules that play a role in how plants adapt and respond to the microgravity environment of space, providing new insight into growing plants for food and oxygen supplies on long-duration missions. Microgravity Experiment Research Locker Incubator (MERLIN)1: Last week MERLIN 1 was automatically safed after a false Payload Potential Fire warning annunciated due to out of limit temperature sensors.Today MERLIN 1 was repowered for troubleshooting.The temperature sensors are now in the expected range and will be monitored for 24 hours.Assuming no anomalous signatures during the monitoring period, the unit will be configured to an operational state tomorrow.

Space Automated Bioproduct Lab (SABL) CO2 Controller Removal: SABL-1s CO2 Incubator Controller was removed for return on SpaceX-9. SPHERES Blue Satellite: The CO2 tank in the SPHERES blue satellite was removed, vented, and packed. Meteor Hard Drive Retrieval: The Meteor Laptop hard drive was retrieved. Mouse Epigenetics Habitat Cage Unit Maintenance: The Mouse Cage Units containing the mice were transferred from the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF) to the glove box to conduct food cartridge exchanges and cleaning activities. The crew also performed troubleshooting activities on the Transportation Cage Units (TCU) by performing individual cover replacements, cage block replacements, and TCU exchanges to prepare for return on SpX-9. The Mouse Cage Units were then returned to CBEF. The Mouse Epigenetics investigation studies altered gene expression patterns in the organs of male mice that spend one month in space, and also examines changes in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of their offspring. Results from the investigation identify genetic alterations that happen after exposure to the microgravity environment of space. Biomolecule Sequencer Surface Pro 3 Hardware Checkout: The crew set up and connected Surface Pro 3 tablets to the wireless network before completing checkout activities to support upcoming Biomolecule Sequencer operations later this week. The Biomolecule Sequencer investigation seeks to demonstrate for the first time that DNA sequencing is feasible in an orbiting spacecraft. A space-based DNA sequencer could identify microbes, diagnose diseases and understand crew member health and potentially help detect DNA-based life elsewhere in the solar system. Fine Motor Skills: A series of interactive tasks on a touchscreen tablet was completed for the Fine Motor Skills investigation. This investigation is critical during long-duration space missions, particularly those skills needed to interact with technologies required in next-generation space vehicles, spacesuits, and habitats. The crewmembers fine motor skills are also necessary for performing tasks in transit or on a planetary surface, such as information access, just-in-time training, subsystem maintenance, and medical treatment. Habitability Human Factors Directed Observations: The crew recorded and submitted a walk-through video documenting observations of life onboard ISS, providing insight related to human factors and habitability. The Habitability investigation collects observations about the relationship between crew members and their environment on the ISS. Observations can help spacecraft designers understand how much habitable volume is required, and whether a missions duration impacts how much space crew members need. Dose Tracker: The crew completed entries for medication tracking on an iPad today. This investigation documents the medication usage of crewmembers before and during their missions by capturing data regarding medication use during spaceflight, including side effect qualities, frequencies and severities. The data is expected to either support or counter anecdotal evidence of medication ineffectiveness during flight and unusual side effects experienced during flight. It is also expected that specific, near-real-time questioning about symptom relief and side effects will provide the data required to establish whether spaceflight-associated alterations in pharmacokinetics (PK) or pharmacodynamics (PD) is occurring during missions. Columbus Payload Power Switching Box (PPSB) &#8211; SDX Switch 1 Reconfiguration: The crew reconfigured the SDX 1 switch on the PPSB1 for RapidScat in Columbus in preparation for tomorrows 63P reboost. Columbus Power Distribution Unit 1 (PDU-1) Troubleshooting: On Monday, ground teams were unable to repower the COLs PDU-1 Outlet 3 which provides operational power to RapidScat and Solar Monitoring Observatory (SOLAR) payloads. Today, ground teams successfully repowered SOLAR from Outlet 3 by turning OFF the Columbus Payload Power Switching Box (PPSB) &#8211; SDX switch 1 to isolate RapidScat from the power feed. RapidScat has active heater power and can remain deactivated with no impact to hardware. Ground teams continue to investigate the anomaly. Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations: Last night Robotics Ground Controllers stowed the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) on Mobile Base System (MBS) Power Data Grapple Fixture #2 (PDGF2). At the end of rigidizing its Latching End Effector (LEE) on MBS PDGF2, the SPDM safed, which has been observed previously. Controllers performed the necessary recovery steps and latched and mated the SPDM LEE to the PDGF. The SSRMS was then maneuvered to grapple the SpX-9 Flight Releasable Grapple Fixture (FRGF) in preparation of the SpX-9 release on Friday.
